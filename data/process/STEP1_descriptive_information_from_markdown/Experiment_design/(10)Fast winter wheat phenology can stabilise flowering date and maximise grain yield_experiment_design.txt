The study was conducted through a series of field experiments over two years across various sites and times of sowing (TOS). It compared a novel fast-winter (FW) wheat cultivar to current elite spring and winter wheat cultivars, as well as near-isogenic lines differing only in major development genes. The experiments were organized as split-plot designs with the whole plot as the time of sowing and the sub-plot as the cultivar. Each experiment had multiple sowing dates, generally starting mid-April and ending mid-May, to assess the impact of sowing date on wheat development and yield. Factors such as temperature accumulation and seasonal conditions were also considered in the analysis【4:2†source】.
