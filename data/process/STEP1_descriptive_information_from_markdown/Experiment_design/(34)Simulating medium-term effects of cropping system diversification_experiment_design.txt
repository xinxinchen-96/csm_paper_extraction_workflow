The study designed a simulation experiment to assess the medium-term effects of cropping system diversification on soil fertility and crop productivity. It utilized the APSIM model to simulate various crop rotation scenarios under two contrasting agro-ecological conditions in South Africa, with differing soil types and rainfall patterns. The experiment incorporated 14 different crop rotations, intercropping systems, fertilizer levels (zero and 70 kg N ha−1), and residue management strategies (retained and removed) over a ten-year period. The goal was to compare the impacts of these variables on grain yield, straw yield, yield trends, production risk, and soil fertility indicators like soil organic carbon (SOC) and mineral nitrogen (Nmin)【4:5†source】.
