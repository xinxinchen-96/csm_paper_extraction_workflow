The experiment was conducted in the AGFACE (Australian Grains Free-Air CO2 Enrichment) facility to study the effects of elevated CO2 levels on the grain quality of two bread wheat cultivars, "Yitpi" and "Janz." The study utilized a field-based experimental setup at Horsham, Victoria, Australia, over three growing seasons (2007-2009). Sixteen plots were divided into four blocks with four replications each year; 8 plots with elevated CO2 (∼550 ppm) and 8 plots with ambient CO2 (∼384 ppm). The design employed a randomized split-split block method with CO2 treatments as the main fixed factor. In 2007, the plots were divided by time of sowing, and in 2008 and 2009 by water supply (rain-fed and irrigated). Different sowing dates were used to push flowering into warmer periods. The experiment aimed to assess the impact of elevated CO2 on physical, nutritional, and rheological properties of wheat under varying growing conditions in a Mediterranean climate【4:0†Fernando_2014_Elevated CO2 alters grain quality of two bread whe.pdf】.
