The experimental design of the study involved conducting field experiments at the Luancheng Agro-ecosystem station on the North China Plain from 1998 to 2001. The study tested five kinds of deficit irrigation schedules based on growth stages of winter wheat, with each treatment replicated three times. The design included an area for grain yield measurement and specific methods for determining 1000-kernel weight and dry matter, among other measurements. The AquaCrop model (version 3.1 Plus) was calibrated using data from one of these treatments (treatment D) during the 1999–2000 period and validated with data from other years. Soil water content was measured using a neutron probe and actual evapotranspiration was calculated by the water balance method【4:1†source】.
