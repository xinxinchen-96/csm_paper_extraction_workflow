The experimental design of the study involves evaluating the extent of yield declines in rice-wheat cropping systems in Asia over a long-term period. The study uses data from experiments conducted at multiple sites across Asia. These experiments were designed to assess trends in rice and wheat yields and understand the possible causes of yield decline. The investigation focuses on several factors including soil nutrient depletion, soil carbon levels, and other soil properties. The experiments utilize specific treatments and crop management practices to systematically analyze these factors【8:0†source】.
