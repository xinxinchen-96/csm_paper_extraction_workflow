The Broadbalk Wheat Experiment, started in autumn 1843, is the world's longest-running long-term experiment. Its design involves dividing the experimental field into long, narrow strips that run the length of the field. Initially, these strips were arranged in a "ridge and furrow" system, creating a distinct area for applying different treatments. The experiment began with single or double strips, which were 3.76 or 7.52 meters wide and approximately 300 meters long. Each strip was used to apply different treatments of fertilizers and manures to study their effects on wheat yield and soil properties【4:14†The Broadbalk Wheat Experiment】.

Notably, the experiment includes various rotations of wheat with other crops and has undergone modifications over time to adapt to new scientific inquiries and practical farming techniques. Modifications since 1967 include the introduction of different wheat varieties, comparative studies of continuous versus rotational cropping, and the application of various fertilizer regimes. The experiment also investigates the effects of herbicides and lime to maintain soil pH and tackles issues like pest and disease control【4:1†The Broadbalk Wheat Experiment】【4:3†The Broadbalk Wheat Experiment】.
