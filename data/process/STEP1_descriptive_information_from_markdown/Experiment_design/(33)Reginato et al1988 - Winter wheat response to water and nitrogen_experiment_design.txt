The study employed a split-split plot experimental design to investigate the response of winter wheat to different levels of water and nitrogen across the North American Great Plains. The experiment involved three main treatments of water levels, four nitrogen levels, and two winter wheat cultivars. These were organized hierarchically where water levels were the main plots, nitrogen levels were the subplots, and the cultivars were the sub-subplots. Water levels were not randomized within the four replications, but nitrogen levels and cultivars within nitrogen levels were randomized. The experiment was conducted at five different locations from Alberta, Canada, to Texas, USA, in 1985 and 1986【4:1†source】.
