The experiment was designed to assess the spatial and temporal variation of carbon dioxide ([CO2]) distribution within Australian Grains Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (AGFACE) rings. This setup was crucial for understanding how elevated [CO2] affects crop growth. The AGFACE system injects pure CO2 into the atmosphere through fumigation tubes forming an octagon. CO2 is mixed with air and transported across the ring by prevailing winds. Monitoring of [CO2] was done using multi-port infrared gas analyzers (IRGA), which logged data at regular intervals, including CO2 concentration, wind speed, and wind direction. Data were collected at various heights and distances from the CO2 source within the rings. The study evaluated [CO2] distribution in rings of different sizes, observing that larger rings maintained target [CO2] levels more consistently than smaller ones【4:1†source】.
