The study used a Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) system in a 9-ha field at the University of Arizona. The experimental design was a strip-split-plot with two main treatment levels of CO2 concentration, replicated four times. These main plots were split into two semicircular subplots to test the effects of two irrigation levels—well-watered (WET) and water-stressed (DRY)—on wheat response to CO2 enrichment. The CO2 levels were elevated to 550 nmol mol^(-1) in the FACE treatment, while the control plots were at ambient CO2 levels of about 370 nmol mol^(-1). Wheat plants were exposed to these conditions during two spring wheat seasons, with irrigation provided via a subsurface drip system【4:0†source】.
