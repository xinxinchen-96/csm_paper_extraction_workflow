The study utilized a split-split-plot experimental design with three replicates to evaluate the impact of climate change on maize yield. The experiments were set up at Mount Makulu, Zambia. The design involved testing different sowing dates, maize cultivars, and nitrogen fertilizer rates as main, sub, and sub-sub plots, respectively. The APSIM-Maize and CERES-Maize models were used to simulate these effects under five global climate models (GCMs) for two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The focus was on the mid-century (2040–2069) timeframe, with climate data and modeling frameworks established using AgMIP protocols【4:0†source】.
