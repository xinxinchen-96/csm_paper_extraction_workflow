The experiment in the study aimed to analyze the effect of plant density on the growth and productivity of winter wheat, focusing on different ear-bearing shoots. It was conducted in field conditions with various plant densities ranging from 5 to 800 plants per square meter. The experiment used a completely randomized design with four replicates and involved hand-sowing winter wheat in small plots of over 1 square meter on fertile clayey soil. The study controlled potential confounding variables by preventing damage from pests, diseases, and lodging, and by ensuring adequate nutrient supply. Various growth metrics were recorded, including the number of tillers and ears per unit area, grain yield, and dry matter yield. The results showed compensation effects and found that maximum grain yield was obtained at a moderate plant density of about 100 plants/m2【4:6†source】.
