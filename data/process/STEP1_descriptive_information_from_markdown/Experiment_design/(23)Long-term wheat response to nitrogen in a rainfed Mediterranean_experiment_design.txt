The experiment in the study was conducted at the Cereal Research Centre in Foggia, Italy, as part of a long-term study on a monoculture wheat system initiated in the 1991/1992 season. The design involved two levels of nitrogen application: 0 kg N ha−1 (0 N) and 90 kg N ha−1 (90 N). The plots for the experiment were set up with two large plots separated by 5 meters of bare soil. One plot received 90 kg N ha−1 divided into two applications: 25 kg N ha−1 at sowing using diammonium phosphate and 65 kg N ha−1 at the end of tillering using urea. The second plot did not receive nitrogen for the entire duration of 17 years【4:0†source】.
