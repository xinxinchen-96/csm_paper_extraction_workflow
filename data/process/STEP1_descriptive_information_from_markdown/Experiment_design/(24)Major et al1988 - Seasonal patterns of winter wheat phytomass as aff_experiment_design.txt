The experiment in this study was designed to evaluate the rates and durations of whole-plant and grain growth of winter wheat at different nitrogen (N) levels and soil water conditions across various locations in the North American Great Plains. The study involved weekly estimates of leaves, stems, and heads under different irrigation and nitrogen combinations for two cultivars at five locations. The experiment focused on the 'Colt' cultivar grown with two combinations: rainfed with different nitrogen levels (W1 with N1 or N2) and irrigated with high nitrogen (W3 with N3). The researchers used these setups to compare different growth metrics and assess location-based variations influenced by latitude, with measurements expressed in terms of phytomass per square meter【4:0†source】.
