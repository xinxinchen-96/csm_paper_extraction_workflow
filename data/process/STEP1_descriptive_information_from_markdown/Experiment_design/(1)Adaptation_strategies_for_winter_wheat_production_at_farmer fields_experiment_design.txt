The experiment in this study was conducted using a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three repetitions over a two-year period. It involved winter wheat planting with the variety Nongda 212, and focused on evaluating different nitrogen fertilizer applications and irrigation levels to determine optimal growth strategies under changing climatic conditions. The study included five different nitrogen treatments using urea as the main nitrogen fertilizer, applied at different growth stages. Various irrigation levels were tested, and traditional practices were compared to analyze yield outcomes and develop adaptation strategies for climate change【4:6†source】.
