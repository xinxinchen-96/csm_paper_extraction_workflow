The study involved a long-term experiment established in 1994, utilizing a rainfed 2-year rotational cropping system consisting of durum wheat and either sunflower or maize. The experiment was conducted on two adjacent fields to allow for each crop to be present every year. Three tillage methods were tested: conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT), and no tillage (NT), with plots of 500 m² each. Additionally, three nitrogen fertilizer rates (N0, N1, N2) were tested within each field, corresponding to 0, 90, and 180 kg N ha−1, respectively, distributed in a split-plot design with two replications. This experimental approach aimed to assess the impacts of these agricultural practices on yield, yield stability, and environmental sustainability in Mediterranean hilly areas【4:3†source】.
