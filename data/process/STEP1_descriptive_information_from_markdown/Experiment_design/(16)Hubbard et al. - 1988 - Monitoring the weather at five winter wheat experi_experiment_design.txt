The experiment described in the study monitored weather conditions at five winter wheat experimental field sites located from Lubbock, Texas to Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. The sites used uniform weather-measurement techniques to monitor variables such as wind speed and direction, solar radiation, air temperature and relative humidity, soil temperature, and precipitation. At two locations, Nebraska and Kansas, data was automatically retrieved via daily computer telecommunications. Data from the remaining locations were collected at the end of each growing season. The study aimed to document weather conditions to facilitate better understanding of treatment effects in winter wheat growth, highlighting the importance of weather monitoring in agricultural research【4:1†source】.
