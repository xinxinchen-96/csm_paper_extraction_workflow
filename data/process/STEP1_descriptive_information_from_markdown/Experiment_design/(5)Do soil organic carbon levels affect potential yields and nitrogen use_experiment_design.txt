The study utilized historical data from Danish national field trials, including 560 winter wheat trials and 309 spring barley trials, conducted over a span of 20 and 17 years, respectively. The experimental design involved these field trials conducted at various sites across Denmark using a block design with 5 replicates per treatment, each with plot sizes ranging from 25 to 35 m². Various mineral fertilizer N application rates were tested, ranging from 0 to 250 kg N ha−1 for winter wheat and 0 to 200 kg N ha−1 for spring barley. The experiments were conducted following conventional farming practices on private farms【4:7†source】.
