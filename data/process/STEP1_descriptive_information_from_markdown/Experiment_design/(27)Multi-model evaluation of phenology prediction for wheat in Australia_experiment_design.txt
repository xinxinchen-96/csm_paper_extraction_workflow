The study involved a multi-model evaluation designed to assess phenology prediction for wheat in Australia using a diverse set of modeling groups. The experiment utilized data from a subset of a multi-cultivar, multi-location, and multi-sowing date trial for the wheat cultivar Janz, which is classified as a fast to moderate maturing cultivar. The study included 10 sites across major wheat-growing regions in Australia with varying sowing years and planting dates, providing a total of 66 different environments (site-sowing date combinations). 

Regular observations were made to determine specific Zadoks growth stages, namely Z30 (youngest leaf sheath erection), Z65 (anthesis half-way), and Z90 (grain hard stage), which are critical for management decisions. The study involved 28 different modeling groups, each tasked with predicting the number of days from sowing to each Zadoks stage using provided weather, soil, and management data. This design helped test the accuracy and variability of phenology predictions across different modeling approaches 【4:1†Multi-model evaluation of phenology prediction for wheat in Australia.pdf】.
