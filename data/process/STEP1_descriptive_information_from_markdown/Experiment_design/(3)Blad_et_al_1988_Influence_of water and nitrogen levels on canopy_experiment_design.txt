The experimental design of the study involved measuring the canopy temperatures of winter wheat using handheld infrared thermometers across five locations in the North American Great Plains during 1985 and 1986. The aim was to determine the occurrence and severity of water stress from different water treatments and the influence of nitrogen (N) fertilization on canopy temperatures. The researchers performed measurements at oblique angles from east and west directions and with a nadir view facing south, usually between 1230 and 1430 CST. These measurements were carried out only on days when the sun was not obscured by clouds【4:0†source】. 

The experiment included three water treatment levels: full irrigation, rain-fed, and 50% of full irrigation, and four nitrogen treatments of approximately 50-60, 100, 160, and 240 kg N ha-1【4:0†source】. These treatments were tested on two wheat cultivars, Colt and a locally adapted cultivar, across different geographical locations: Lubbock, TX; Manhattan, KS; Sandhills Agricultural Laboratory in NE; Mandan, ND; and Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada【4:0†source】. The study assessed the statistical differences in canopy temperatures due to these variables at the various sites【4:6†source】.
