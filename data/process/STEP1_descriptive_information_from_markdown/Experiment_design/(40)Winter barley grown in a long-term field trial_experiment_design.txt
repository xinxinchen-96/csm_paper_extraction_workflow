The study employed a long-term field trial initiated in 1976, investigating the effect of nitrogen (N) fertilization on winter barley. The experiment was conducted at the Hohenschulen Experimental Farm in Northern Germany, utilizing a rotation that included winter oilseed rape, winter wheat, spring oats, and winter barley. The trial involved applying calcium ammonium nitrate fertilizers with 27% N at three barley growth stages: the beginning of spring growth, stem elongation, and ear emergence. These stages were designated N1, N2, and N3 respectively, with N rates of 0, 40, 80, or 120 kg N ha−1, leading to 64 different N treatment combinations. The experimental design followed a split-plot structure due to practical constraints【4:0†Winter barley grown in a long-term field trial.pdf】.
