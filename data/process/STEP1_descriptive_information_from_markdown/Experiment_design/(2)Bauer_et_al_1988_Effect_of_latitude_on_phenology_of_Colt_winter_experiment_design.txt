The experiment in the study was designed to assess the effect of latitude on the development rate of winter wheat, independent of growing degree days (GDD). It involved the cultivar 'Colt' grown in identically-conducted trials at two locations: Manhattan, KS, and Mandan, ND, over a 2-year period. The study also considered different nitrogen rates, water levels, and cultivars. Plant development stages were monitored at least once a week using designations based on the Haun or Zadoks-Chang-Konzak scale. This experimental setup aimed to determine if the pre-anthesis development rate of 'Colt' winter wheat differed due to latitude, as expressed by accumulation of GDD and photothermal units (PTU), and to assess the effect of nitrogen and water application levels on pre-anthesis plant development rate【4:0†source】.
