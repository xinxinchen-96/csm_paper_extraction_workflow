The study uses a randomized complete block design with three replications to evaluate the DSSAT-CSM model's performance in simulating long-term trends in grain yields, soil organic carbon (SOC), and soil organic nitrogen (SON). It involves a long-term (1979-1992) maize-wheat rotation experiment conducted on the Loess Plateau of China with four selected treatments: no fertilizer (N0), 90 kg N ha−1 from urea (N90), 30 kg N ha−1 from maize or wheat straw plus 90 kg N ha−1 from urea (SN90), and 40 kg N ha−1 from cattle manure plus 90 kg N ha−1 from urea (MN90)【4:0†file】. The study also conducts sensitivity analysis by varying nitrogen application levels and utilizes generated weather data to assess their effects on grain yields【4:2†file】.
