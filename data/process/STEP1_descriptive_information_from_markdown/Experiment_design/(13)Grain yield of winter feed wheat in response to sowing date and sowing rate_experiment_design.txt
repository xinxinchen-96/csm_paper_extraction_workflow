The study was designed to investigate the effects of sowing dates and sowing rates on the grain yield of irrigated feed wheat. Three field experiments were conducted over three seasons (2012-13 to 2014-15) at Leeston, Canterbury. The experiments analyzed various sowing dates in February, March, and April with four to five different sowing rates. The experimental setup was a split-plot design, where the sow date was the main plot and the population was the sub-plot, each with four replicates. The study aimed to determine optimal sowing times and rates to maximize wheat yield, taking into account interactions between sowing date and rate【4:1†source】.
