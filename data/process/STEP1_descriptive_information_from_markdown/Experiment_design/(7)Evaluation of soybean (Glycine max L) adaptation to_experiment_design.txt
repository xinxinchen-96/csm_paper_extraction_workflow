The study's experimental design involved planting two soybean cultivars, RGT Sirelia (MG 000) and ES Mentor (MG 00), in three rainfed trials in 2019. These trials took place at two locations in France: the Institut Polytechnique UniLaSalle (Beauvais) and ANTEDIS company (Catillon-Fumechon). Weather data, including daily temperatures, precipitation, and solar radiation, were recorded at both sites. Soil samples were analyzed to 90 cm depth at each site. The planting at Beauvais was done on April 24 and May 17, and at Catillon-Fumechon on April 23. The experimental plots, measuring 10 m by 2.7 m, were planted at a density of 70 plants per square meter with a row spacing of 0.45 m. Each treatment was replicated five times and arranged in a randomized complete block design. Seeds were inoculated with Bradyrhizobium japonicum prior to planting【4:0†source】.
