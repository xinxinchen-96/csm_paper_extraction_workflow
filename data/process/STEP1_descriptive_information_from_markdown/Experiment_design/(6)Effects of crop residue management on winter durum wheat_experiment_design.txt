The study conducted a long-term experiment starting in 1977 to investigate the effects of different crop residue (CR) management strategies on winter durum wheat in a continuous cropping system. The experimental design involved a complete randomized block setup with five replicates. The experiment was carried out on an experimental farm in Foggia, Southern Italy, on soil with clay-loam texture.

There were eight treatments tested, which included burning of wheat straw and stubble, incorporation of crop residues with varying levels of nitrogen fertilization (0, 50, 100, and 150 kg ha−1 using urea), and with or without irrigation (50 mm of water). The key parameters measured were grain yield, grain protein content, and hectolitric weight. Statistical analysis included the use of linear mixed effect models to account for spatial error autocorrelation, allowing a more accurate interpretation of the treatment effects【4:3†source】.
