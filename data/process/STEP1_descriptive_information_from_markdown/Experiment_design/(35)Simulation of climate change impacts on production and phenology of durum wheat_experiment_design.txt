The experiment design of the study involved a triple lattice with 8-rowed plots, each measuring 5.9 meters long and 1.5 meters wide, with an approximate area of 10 square meters. The plots featured rows spaced 0.18 meters apart and a plant density of approximately 300 plants per square meter. The study evaluated the impact of climate change on the yield and phenology of three durum wheat varieties—Creso, Duilio, and Simeto—using the CERES-Wheat model simulations. These varieties are well-adapted to Mediterranean conditions and were grown under rain-fed systems【4:0†source】.
