The study was conducted in 1985 and 1986 across five locations in the North American Great Plains. It aimed to evaluate the effects of irrigation and soil nitrogen levels on the grain yield and its components for winter wheat. The experimental design involved three soil water levels and four nitrogen levels. Yield data were collected and analyzed using regression analysis to detect associations among yield components and to assess the effects of water and nitrogen on these components. In addition, treatment means were compared using analysis of variance【4:0†Major et al1988 - Winter wheat grain yield response to water and nit】.
