The study conducted in the document focuses on the productivity of winter wheat under different light environments. It describes an experimental setup where artificial shading treatments, such as continuous shade (CS) and periodic shade (PS), were applied to simulate different light conditions. The aim was to use the STICS crop model to predict the response of winter wheat under these varying light conditions. The study was carried out at the Experimental Farm of Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech in Belgium over two consecutive growing seasons【4:4†How does STICS crop model simulate crop growth and productivity under.pdf】. 

However, there is no specific mention of whether the crops were irrigated or rainfed directly in these excerpts. It is noted that the model is capable of simulating the effects of various environmental stresses, but the specifics of irrigation versus rainfed conditions are not explicit in the provided results【4:0†How does STICS crop model simulate crop growth and productivity under.pdf】.
