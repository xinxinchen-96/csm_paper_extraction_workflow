In the study, both rainfed (dryland agriculture) and responses to irrigation are considered. It evaluates maize and wheat yields under various soil water conditions, mentioning effects of both drought and humid conditions. The study discusses irrigation in terms of the interaction between irrigation and nitrogen fertilization rates for maize yield【4:0†source】. Moreover, the study was conducted in a semi-arid to semi-humid region, which indicates reliance on both rainfed and irrigated practices【4:6†source】. The experimental design also simulates scenarios that would involve irrigation events, even though the emphasis is more on rainfed conditions【4:14†source】.
