The study refers to both irrigation aspects and the impact of water availability on yield stability. It mentions that in dry regions, yield stability may be affected by water availability【4:12†source】. Additionally, the precipitation data for the experimental periods is provided, indicating that rainfall plays a significant role in the study【4:2†source】. Although there is no explicit mention of whether irrigation is used in the experiments, the focus on precipitation and its effect on yield suggests that the study is likely concerning rainfed conditions【4:2†source】.
