The study includes both irrigated and rainfed conditions. Average full irrigation (W3) and rainfed (Wl) yields were compared at each location to examine the effects of irrigation and location on yield. The study emphasizes the impact of irrigation on increasing yields, primarily through an increased number of spikes【4:0†Major et al1988 - Winter wheat grain yield response to water and nit.pdf】.
