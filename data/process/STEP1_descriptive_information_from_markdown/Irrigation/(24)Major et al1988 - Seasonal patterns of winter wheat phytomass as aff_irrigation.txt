The study examines both irrigated and rainfed conditions. It compares the growth rates and yield of winter wheat under these two conditions, with the irrigated treatment labeled as W3 and the rainfed treatment labeled as W1【4:0†source】. The rainfed growth rates were 60-70% of the irrigated growth rates in the study【4:8†source】.
