The study uses the DSSAT-CERES-Maize model to simulate long-term continuous maize production with and without fertilization. It does consider irrigation management as part of the simulations but does not specifically mention whether the field experiments were under irrigated or rainfed conditions. However, it notes that maize yield is significantly related to growing season precipitation, indicating that rainfed conditions may be vital to understanding yield variability【4:3†source】【4:15†source】.
