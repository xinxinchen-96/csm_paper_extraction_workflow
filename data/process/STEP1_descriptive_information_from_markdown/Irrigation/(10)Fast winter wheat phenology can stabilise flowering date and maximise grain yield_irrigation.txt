The study involves both irrigated and rainfed conditions. It mentions that a small amount of irrigation was applied to ensure germination. Specifically, irrigation was applied using drip irrigation directly onto the seed row, with 8 mm at Berriwillock and 15 mm at Temora. However, it is presumed that this small amount did not contribute significantly to crop transpiration and yield, focusing on the rainfed nature of the conditions observed during the study【4:7†source】.
