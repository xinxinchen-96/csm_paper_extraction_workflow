The study investigated the response of winter wheat to water and nitrogen fertility treatments, which included both irrigated and rainfed conditions. The experimental design involved three irrigation regimes, where "W1" represents dryland (rainfed) conditions, "W2" is an intermediate level of irrigation, and "W3" is a well-watered condition【4:2†source】.
