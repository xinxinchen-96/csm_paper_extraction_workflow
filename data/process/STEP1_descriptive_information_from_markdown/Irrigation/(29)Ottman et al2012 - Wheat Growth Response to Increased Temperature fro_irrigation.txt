The study described in the document utilized irrigation as part of its methodology. After the initial irrigation, which was necessary to germinate the seeds and fill the soil profile to field capacity, water was applied on a weekly or biweekly basis depending on measurements obtained from a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This irrigation system was used to replace potential evapotranspiration minus rainfall【4:0†source】.
