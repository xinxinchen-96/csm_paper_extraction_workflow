The study includes experiments where crops were irrigated under different conditions. The FACE, AgIIS, and FISE experiments involved irrigation treatments where irrigation was carefully managed and scheduled. For instance, in the FACE experiments, crops were irrigated using a subsurface drip system, and the amount of water was adjusted to replace evapotranspiration with different levels of water supply being tested【4:1†source】. Additionally, in the FISE experiments, irrigation scheduling was tested with different methods, including the FAO-56 methodology and an approach based on leaf area【4:0†source】【4:10†source】. These conditions indicate that the crops were irrigated, not solely rainfed, for the purposes of these experiments, although some rainfall was also received【4:0†source】.
