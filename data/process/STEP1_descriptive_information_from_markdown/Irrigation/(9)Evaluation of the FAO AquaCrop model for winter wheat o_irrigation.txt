The study in the document "Evaluation of the FAO AquaCrop model for winter wheat" includes both irrigated and rainfed treatments. Specifically, "treatment E" is designated as the rainfed treatment, while other treatments involve deficit irrigation【4:3†source】. Various irrigation amounts were applied before the winter dormancy period to ensure the survival of winter wheat during the cold season, except for treatment E, which was not irrigated after spring and thus considered rainfed【4:18†source】.
