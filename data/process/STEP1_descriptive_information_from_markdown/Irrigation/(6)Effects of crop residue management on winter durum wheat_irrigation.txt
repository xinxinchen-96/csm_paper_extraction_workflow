The study on crop residue management in winter durum wheat included both irrigated and rainfed systems. It compared the effects of different crop residue management practices, including those with and without irrigation, on wheat yields. Treatments in the study involved crop residue incorporation with varying nitrogen fertilization levels and some treatments included irrigation to ensure good soil moisture conditions【4:3†Effects of crop residue management on winter durum wheat.pdf】. Specifically, irrigation of 50 mm was mentioned as a measure to maintain good soil water conditions necessary for the decomposition of crop residues【4:6†Effects of crop residue management on winter durum wheat.pdf】.
