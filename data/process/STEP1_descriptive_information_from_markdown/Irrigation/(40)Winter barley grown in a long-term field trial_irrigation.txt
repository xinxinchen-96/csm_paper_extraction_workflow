The study focuses on winter barley grown in a long-term field trial with varied nitrogen supply. It is primarily related to irrigation in terms of nitrogen fertilization rather than being rainfed. The research involves multiple nitrogen treatments applied at specific growth stages to optimize nitrogen use and improve grain yield, with sufficient rainfall mentioned as benefiting the utilization of late-season nitrogen【4:0†Winter barley grown in a long-term field trial.pdf】【4:1†Winter barley grown in a long-term field trial.pdf】.
