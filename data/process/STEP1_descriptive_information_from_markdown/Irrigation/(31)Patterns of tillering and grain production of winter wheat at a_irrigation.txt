The study appears to focus on the effects of plant density on winter wheat, but does not specifically mention whether the wheat was irrigated or rainfed. However, it does note that the supply of water and nutrients was sufficient, and competition was mainly for light【4:3†source】. This suggests that controlled conditions were maintained, likely with adequate water supply, but it does not specify irrigation or reliance on rainfall directly.
