The study evaluates soybean adaptation to northern European regions under both rainfed and irrigated conditions. It identifies the main yield limiting factors for soybean in these two scenarios. The results show that irrigation during the grain filling period increases yield potential to levels similar to non-water-limited scenarios. However, precipitation amount and duration during the flowering to physiological maturity period are also crucial for yield under rainfed conditions【4:0†Evaluation of soybean (Glycine max L) adaptation to.pdf】.
