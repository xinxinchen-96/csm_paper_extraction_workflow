The study mentioned in the file "Hubbard et al. - 1988 - Monitoring the weather at five winter wheat experimental field sites.pdf" involves monitoring weather variables in winter wheat experimental field sites. However, it does not explicitly state whether the wheat is specifically irrigated or rainfed. The focus is on the weather conditions and their effects on winter wheat growth, including precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as factors affecting soil moisture availability【4:9†source】.
