The Broadbalk Wheat Experiment describes the soil at the study location as "a somewhat heavy loam, with a subsoil of raw yellowish red clay, but resting in its turn upon chalk, which provides good natural drainage"【4:0†The Broadbalk Wheat Experiment.pdf】.

However, the document does not provide explicit longitude and latitude coordinates for the study location in the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment. The experiment is historically located at Rothamsted Research in Harpenden, UK【4:3†The Broadbalk Wheat Experiment.pdf】.
