The study uses national field trials conducted in Denmark between 1989 and 2009, utilizing data from 560 winter wheat sites and 309 spring barley sites. The soil data used includes soil organic carbon, soil texture determined by the hydrometer method, and soil classification according to the Danish soil classification system. The study involves detailed metrics such as soil organic carbon (SOC) levels, clay content, and the impact of these factors on crop yields and nitrogen use efficiency【4:2†source】.

Longitude and latitude data are not explicitly mentioned in the provided document. Instead, the study covers Denmark geographically by distributed field sites, highlighting that specific coordinates for some sites were missing【4:5†source】. The locations for the trials are shown in an overview map figure, but coordinates are not listed in the text【4:16†source】.
