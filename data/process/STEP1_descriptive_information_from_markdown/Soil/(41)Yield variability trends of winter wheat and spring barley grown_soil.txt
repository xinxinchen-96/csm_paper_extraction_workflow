The study used soil data from the Askov Long-term Experiment located at Lermarken, South Jutland, Denmark. The soil is characterized by terminal morainic deposits from the Weichsel glacial stage with a coarse sandy loam texture consisting of 11% clay. The soil carbon content ranges from 1.3 (0–20 cm soil depth) down to 0.1 (50–100 cm soil depth). Soil bulk density ranges from 1.5 to 1.7 g/cm³【4:2†source】.

The geographic coordinates provided in the study are 55°28'N latitude and 9°07'E longitude【4:0†source】.
