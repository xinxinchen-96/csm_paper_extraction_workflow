The study utilized soil data from the North American Great Plains, specifically at different experimental locations. The study was conducted at five locations:

1. Lubbock, TX
2. Manhattan, KS
3. Sandhills Agricultural Laboratory (SAL) near Tryon, NE
4. Mandan, ND
5. Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada【4:11†Blad_et_al_1988_Influence_of water and nitrogen levels on canopy.pdf】.

These locations cover a variety of soil types appropriate for the study's examination of water stress on canopy temperatures. The document, however, does not specify the exact longitudes and latitudes of these locations.
