The study uses soil input parameters obtained from soil analysis or derived from basic soil measurements. Pedotransfer functions were utilized to define the gravimetric water content at field capacity and at wilting point for each soil layer. The soil is described as a Luvisol according to the WRB classification by FAO, and this description was used consistently for all treatments across both growing seasons【4:0†source】.

The study was conducted at the experimental farm of Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech, with the geographical coordinates of 50°33′ N latitude and 4°42′ E longitude in the Hesbaye region, Belgium【4:2†source】.
