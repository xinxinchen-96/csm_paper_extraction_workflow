The study used climate data based on daily interpolated meteorological data for 44 grids of 40 × 40 km covering Denmark. For each location, the data for the grid containing the experimental site was used. It included temperature averages, global radiation averages, and precipitation for different seasons【4:0†source】. However, the specific longitude and latitude coordinates were not mentioned; instead, the study covered all climatic regions and soil types in Denmark【4:11†source】.
