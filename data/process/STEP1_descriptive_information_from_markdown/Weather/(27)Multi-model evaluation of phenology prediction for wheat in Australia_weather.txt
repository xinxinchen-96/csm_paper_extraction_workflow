The study used data from several sites across Australia, with the evaluation data originating from six sites: Bungunya (Queensland), Corrigin (West Australia), Eradu (West Australia), Lake Bolac (Victoria), Minnipa (South Australia), and Nangwee (Queensland)【4:9†source】. These sites are presented on a map in the document showing their respective locations【4:9†source】.

As for weather data, the study included average temperatures, photoperiod (day length), and days to full vernalization to characterize the environments【4:9†source】. Additionally, the document outlines the locations of the calibration and evaluation sites across the Australian cropping zones【4:9†source】. Specific longitude and latitude data are not explicitly provided in the snippets available, but it is implied that this data is part of the detailed site characterization in the referenced articles and figures【4:9†source】.
