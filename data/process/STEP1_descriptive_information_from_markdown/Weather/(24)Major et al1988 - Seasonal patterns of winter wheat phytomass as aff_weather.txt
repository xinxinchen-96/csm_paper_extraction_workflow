The study uses weather data in the context of determining the rate and duration of winter wheat growth phases across different latitudes. The study involves five locations on the North American Great Plains, but specific longitude and latitude coordinates are not provided in the visible parts of the document. The focus was on comparing temperature regimes and their impact on plant growth phases rather than detailing specific weather data sources or geographical coordinates【4:1†source】.
