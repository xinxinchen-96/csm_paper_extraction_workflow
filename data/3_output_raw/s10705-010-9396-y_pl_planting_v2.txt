### Summary
The integrated data provides a detailed overview of maize cultivation practices, including historical trends in planting dates, plant populations, and row spacing. While some variables lack explicit values, the available information highlights significant changes over the years, such as an increase in plant population and a reduction in row spacing in 2008. This data is crucial for understanding historical cultivation methods and for planning future maize production strategies. 

The absence of specific values for several variables indicates areas where further research or data collection may be beneficial to enhance the understanding of maize cultivation practices.
