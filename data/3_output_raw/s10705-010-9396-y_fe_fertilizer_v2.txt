2. **Fertilizer Application Year (FEYR)**
   - The years of application range from **1959 to 2008**, indicating a long-term study that spans five decades.

3. **Fertilizer Application Day of Year (FEDAY)**
   - Calculated based on the dates provided:
     - Example: May 5 = Day 125, June 19 = Day 170.
     - Other dates can be similarly calculated, providing a numerical representation of application timing throughout the year.

4. **Fertilizer Material (FECD)**
   - **Starter Fertilizer**: N-P-K formulation providing:
     - 16.8 kg N ha-1
     - 67.2 kg P2O5 ha-1
     - 33.6 kg K2O ha-1
   - **Side-Dress Fertilizer**: Primarily nitrogen (N) application:
     - 112 kg N ha-1

5. **Name or Notes for Fertilizer Application (FECD_NAME)**
   - **Starter Fertilizer**: "Starter fertilizer application"
   - **Side-Dress Fertilizer**: "Side-dress N fertilizer application"

6. **Fertilizer Application Method (FEACD)**
   - **Starter Fertilizer**: Broadcast incorporated, ensuring even distribution and incorporation into the soil.
   - **Side-Dress Fertilizer**: Band application, targeting the root zone for optimal nutrient uptake.

7. **Fertilizer Application Depth (FEDEP)**
   - **Starter Fertilizer**: Incorporated into the soil (depth not specified, assumed to be shallow).
   - **Side-Dress Fertilizer**: Applied at a depth of 2â€“5 cm, optimizing nutrient availability to plants.

8. **Total Amount of Fertilizer Applied (FEAM)**
   - **Starter Fertilizer**: 
     - 16.8 kg N ha-1
     - 67.2 kg P2O5 ha-1
     - 33.6 kg K2O ha-1
   - **Side-Dress Fertilizer**: 112 kg N ha-1

9. **Nitrogen (Elemental) in Applied Fertilizer (FEAMN)**
   - Total N from **Starter**: 16.8 kg N ha-1
   - Total N from **Side-Dress**: 112 kg N ha-1
   - **Total N applied per year**: 128.8 kg N ha-1

10. **Nitrate in Applied Fertilizer, as Elemental N (FENO3)**
    - Not specified in the data provided.

11. **Ammonium in Applied Fertilizer, as Elemental N (FENH4)**
    - Not specified in the data provided.

12. **Urea in Applied Fertilizer, as Elemental N (FEUREA)**
    - Not specified in the data provided.

13. **Phosphorus (Elemental) in Applied Fertilizer (FEAMP)**
    - Total P from **Starter**: 67.2 kg P2O5 ha-1
    - To convert P2O5 to elemental P: 
      - 67.2 kg P2O5 ha-1 * (31/142) = 15.4 kg P ha-1

14. **Potassium (Elemental) in Applied Fertilizer (FEAMK)**
    - Total K from **Starter**: 33.6 kg K2O ha-1
    - To convert K2O to elemental K: 
      - 33.6 kg K2O ha-1 * (39/94.2) = 14.4 kg K ha-1

### Conclusion
The data provides a comprehensive overview of the fertilization practices over a 50-year period, detailing application dates, methods, and amounts for both starter and side-dress fertilizers. The specific values for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are highlighted, while some values for ammonium and urea are not specified. This information is crucial for understanding the long-term effects of fertilization on crop yields and soil health in agricultural practices.
