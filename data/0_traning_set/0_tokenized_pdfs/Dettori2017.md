# a b s t r a c t

The CERES-Wheat crop model was used to simulate grain yields, kernel weights and anthesis dates for three Italian durum wheat varieties (Creso, Duilio and Simeto) under climate change projections at two typical Mediterranean environments (Ussana and Benatzu sites) located in Southern Sardinia (Italy). The model was calibrated and validated in a previous modelling study using long-term weather data from the same experimental sites and agronomic data-sets of the same sites and varieties over the period 1973–2004. To assess the responses of durum wheat varieties to climate changes, 48 synthetic climates based on the combination of increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall were used to represent paths of possible future climate change. The simulated impacts of climate projections on durum wheat varieties at both sites were: grain yield reduction, slightly increasing kernel weight, and earlier anthesis dates. The late variety Creso showed a larger grain yield reduction compared to the early genotypes Duilio and Simeto. Anticipation of time to flowering was larger at Ussana (medium-low fertility soil) than at Benatzu (high fertility soil) with no differences between varieties. Earlier anthesis response was due to temperature increase rather than rainfall reduction, since in the CERES-Wheat model as well as in the majority of crop growth models water availability has no effect on crop development rate. Predictions for kernel weight were more uncertain with a slightly increasing trend in response to increasing temperatures and decreasing rainfall. The CERES-Wheat crop model seems to capture fairly well the greater resilience shown by early genotypes in Mediterranean rainfed conditions. In general, the CERES-Wheat model showed results in line with the findings from real experiments in different pedoclimatic conditions. For these reasons, CERES-Wheat appeared to be reliable when used to evaluate plant responses to projected climate change conditions and can represent a useful tool for developing adaptation strategies and measures such as the choice and selection of adapted genotypes to tackle the negative impact of climate change.

# **2. Materials and methods**

## 2.1. Study sites and experimental data

This study was carried out at two different sites, Benatzu and Ussana, within the experimental farm of San Michele owned by AGRIS (Agricultural Research Agency of Sardinia) (Lat. 39◦24 N, Long. 9◦5 E). The farm is located in the Campidano plain, an important durum wheat growing area of Southern Sardinia, Italy.

Durum wheat is a major crop in the study area. The climate is Mediterranean, with warm and dry summers and mild winters.

The area shows great soil variability. In particular, the soil of Ussana (114 m a.s.l.), located in a hilly area, is typical of mediumand low-fertility rain-fed durum wheat growing areas of Sardinia and the Mediterranean. It is a sandy clay loam soil, with a percentage of sand greater than 50%. The drainage is moderate, and the stone percentage is about 20%.

The soil of Benatzu (80 m a.s.l.), located in a flat area, is typical of the high-yielding potential rain-fed durum wheat growing areas of

Sardinia and the Mediterranean. It is a clay loam soil with a fraction of stones of about 30% and a clay percentage of about 40%.

Daily maximum and minimum air temperatures (◦C) and daily rainfall amounts (mm) over the period 1973–2004 were recorded by an automated weather station (SILIDATA AD2, SILIMET s.r.l., Modena, Italy) located in the experimental farm. Daily global solar radiation values (MJ m2 d−1) were estimated using the software RadEst 3.00 [(Donatelli](#page-9-0) et [al.,](#page-9-0) [2003).](#page-9-0)

Table 1 shows the results concerning the soils classification and the chemical and physical characterization, in order to provide the data required by the model.

Agronomic management and durum wheat experimental data over the period 1973–2004 from both sites came from the Italian Durum Wheat Variety Trials ([http://sitoentecra.it/portale/cra](http://sitoentecra.it/portale/cra_dati_istituto) [dati](http://sitoentecra.it/portale/cra_dati_istituto) [istituto)](http://sitoentecra.it/portale/cra_dati_istituto). The experimental design consisted in a triple lattice with 8-rowed plots. Each plot was 5.9 m long and 1.5 m wide with an approximate surface of 10 m2 and rows spaced 0.18 m apart. Plant density was about 300 plants m−2. The durum wheat varieties Creso, medium-late and short variety, Duilio early-medium and medium-tall variety, and Simeto, early and short variety, well adapted to Mediterranean environmental conditions and grown in rain-fed system, were used to evaluate the potential impact of climate change on durum wheat yield and phenology using CERES-Wheat model simulations. Data were collected in order to initialize the model (i.e. amount and date of fertilizer applications, previous crop, sowing and harvesting dates, sowing depth, plant density), as well as to compare the results from the crop model simulations under climate change projections concerning the harvest and the crop development (i.e. grain yield, kg ha−1; grain weight, g; anthesis date; day after planting-dap) with the observed data from the experimental sites (baseline climate). A summary of the main agronomic management information used to initialize the CERES-Wheat simulations over the three durum wheat varieties are reported in Table 2.

## 2.2. CERES-Wheat simulations and climate projections

CERES-Wheat model was used to perform crop growth simulations of durum wheat under future climate conditions only for the baseline CO2 level (360 ppm) and then assess the potential impact of future climates on yield and phenology of durum wheat. Simulation experiments were based on the same dataset utilized by [Dettori](#page-9-0) et [al.](#page-9-0) [(2011a)](#page-9-0) to derive the so-called genetic coefficients for Creso, Duilio, and Simeto durum wheat varieties (Table A1). Details about the calibration and validation results are provided in Tables A2–A5 and in Supplement 6. In this study, the calibration coefficients were used to perform crop growth simulations under climate projections.

Although simulations were performed using the agronomic and management data observed during the period 1973–2004,the analysis of the simulations was limited to the years when field trial tests were conducted simultaneously on all varieties (i.e. years 1990–2004 for Benatzu and 1989–2004 for Ussana)in order to have a more homogeneous comparison between the durum wheat genotypes. In particular,the simulations were performed on a daily time step, and conducted as a succession of independent growing season, with the moisture content of the top soil set at 75% of field capacity at the beginning of each season. The starting date of all simulations was set on August 1st of each year, considering the growing season from October to June. The planting date was set, for each year, on the observed date, which varied depending on the first useful rainfall occurrences in autumn. The end of the growing season was calculated by taking into account the observed harvest dates for each year. All the agronomic data, such as previous crops and fertilizer management, were set in the experimental file.

Since future climate scenarios cover a wide range of possible future climates and have non-negligible uncertainties, we have adopted an empirical approach to study the different effects of climate change on durum wheat. A set of 48 synthetic climates, based on projections of climate model simulations for the Mediterranean Region, was developed by adjusting the baseline air temperature and precipitation records (actual climate, 1973–2004, at Benatzu and Ussana experimental sites) by between +1 and +6 ◦C at 1 ◦C intervals, and by between −5% and −30% at 5% intervals, respectively. The incremental approach is a relatively straightforward and popular procedure for rapid impact assessment [(Arnell](#page-9-0) [and](#page-9-0) [Reynard,](#page-9-0) [1996;](#page-9-0) [Arnell,](#page-9-0) [1998;](#page-9-0) [Pilling](#page-9-0) [and](#page-9-0) [Jones,](#page-9-0) [1999;](#page-9-0) [Arnell,](#page-9-0) [2003;](#page-9-0) [Diaz-Nieto](#page-9-0) [and](#page-9-0) [Wilby,](#page-9-0) [2005;](#page-9-0) [Pirttioja](#page-9-0) et [al.,](#page-9-0) [2015)](#page-9-0) with clear advantages (the ease/speed of application and the direct scaling of the scenario in line with changes suggested by the GCM or RCM, the greater capability of resolving many ofthe regional- and local-scale processes that are often required for impact studies compared to GCMs) and clear disadvantages (several properties ofthe data, such as the range and variability, remain unchanged). This incremental approach is commonly used to study the sensitivity of an exposure unit to a wide range of variations in climate, facilitating the

**Fig. 1.** Synthetic climates developed adjusting the baseline temperature and precipitation records of the experimental sites by between +1 ◦C and +6 ◦C at 1 ◦C intervals, and by between −5% to −30% at 5% intervals, respectively. The 6 climate projections with increasing temperatures (T1, . . ., T6), the 6 climates with decreasing rainfall (R5, . . ., R30), and the 36 climates derived from the combination of increasing temperatures and decreasing rainfall were used in conjunction with the CERES-Wheat crop model to determine the potential impact of climate change on crop production and phenology of three durum wheat varieties.

construction of response surfaces and assisting in identifying critical thresholds or discontinuities of response to a changing climate [(Terjung](#page-10-0) et [al.,](#page-10-0) [1984;Rosenzweig](#page-10-0) et [al.,](#page-10-0) [1996;Mearns](#page-10-0) et [al.,](#page-10-0) [2001).](#page-10-0)In this study, incremental climate projections were developed using constant changes throughout the year and following the scheme reported illustrated in Fig. 1.

The selection ofthese synthetic climates was guided by information and data from recent global and regional climate simulations over the Mediterranean Region. Therefore, they are in line with global and regional projections, representative of the potential range of future climate changes in the Mediterranean, and physically plausible and consistent. Despite their somewhat arbitrary nature and the use of constant changes throughout the year, they capture a wide range of possible changes in Mediterranean climate and offer a simple and useful tool for evaluating both the potential impacts of climate change on durum wheat production and the response to climate change of the CERES-Wheat model.

The model was run using the 48 synthetic climates, for the three varieties grown in two sites. The simulation results concerning the grain yield, the seed weight, and the anthesis date were analyzed to assess the impacts of climate change projections on the crop.
