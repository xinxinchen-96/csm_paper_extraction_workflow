## Abstract

Crop multi-model ensembles (MME) have proven to be effective in increasing the accuracy of simulations in modelling experiments. However, the ability of MME to capture crop responses to changes in sowing dates and densities has not yet been investigated. These management interventions are some of the main levers for adapting cropping systems to climate change. Here, we explore the performance of a MME of 29 wheat crop models to predict the effect of changing sowing dates and rates on yield and yield components, on two sites located in a high-yielding environment in New Zealand. The experiment was conducted for 6 years and provided 50 combinations of sowing date, sowing density and growing season. We show that the MME simulates seasonal growth of wheat well under standard sowing conditions, but fails under early sowing and high sowing rates. The comparison between observed and simulated in-season fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (FIPAR) for early sown wheat shows that the MME does not capture the decrease of crop above ground biomass during winter months due to senescence. Models need to better account for tiller competition for light, nutrients, and water during vegetative growth, and early tiller senescence and tiller mortality, which are exacerbated by early sowing, high sowing densities, and warmer winter temperatures.

Keywords: Multi-model ensemble, sowing date, sowing density, tillering, tiller mortality, wheat, yield potential.

# Materials and methods

#### *Experimental dataset*

The feld trials were carried out by the New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research and the Foundation for Arable Research at two farms located at Leeston (43° 45ʹ S, 172° 15ʹ E) and Wakanui (43° 58ʹ S, 171° 48ʹ E) in the Canterbury Region of the South Island of New Zealand (Craigie *et al.*, 2015). The farm located at Wakanui has achieved the Guinness World Record for the highest wheat yield twice, in 2017 and in 2020. The local winter wheat cultivar 'Wakanui' was grown under non-stress conditions for six consecutive years, frst at Leeston (from 2012–2013 to 2014–2015) and then at Wakanui (from 2015–2016 to 2017–2018) (see [Table 1)](#page-3-0). 'Wakanui' is a soft wheat with very high yield potential associated with a long grain-flling period.

In the Canterbury region of New Zealand, winter wheat is usually sown between early April and mid-May, with some farmers sowing in late March in recent years (Craigie *et al.*, 2015). The objective of the trials was to test if sowing earlier (February or early March), and therefore increasing the canopy duration and the radiation interception, would increase grain yield. Four sowing dates were tested: February, early March, late March, and April ([Table 1)](#page-3-0). At Leeston, the efect of sowing dates was studied in combination with four sowing densities: 50, 100, 150, and 200 seeds m−2, while at Wakanui, only the locally recommended sowing density was used (150 seeds m−2).

The objective of the Leeston trials was to increase wheat production in a high yielding environment without water and nitrogen stress. The trials investigated the complex interaction between tiller development, ear population, and grain yield, with the goal of fnding the optimal sowing density for an early sowing date. The experiments consisted of a split-plot design with sowing dates as the main plots and sowing rates as the subplots, with four replicates. The Wakanui trials used a single sowing density and investigated diferent cultivars, sowing dates, and the use of plant growth regulators (2015–2016) or defoliation (2016–2017 and 2017–2018), at diferent sowing dates. The experiments were designed as randomized blocks with sowing dates as the main plots and cultivar by plant growth regulation or defoliation as the subplots, replicated four times. In our study, we considered only the data of the 'Wakanui' cultivar grown under standard growth regulation and without defoliation.

The feld management was adapted each year to obtain ideal growth conditions: crops received a yearly N fertilization of between 122 and 284 kg N ha−1 and irrigation up to 210 mm of water.

Individual plots (12 m×1.65 m) were drilled into a top worked seed bed. At both sites, the soil type was Temuka clay loam (Fluventic Endoaquents in the USDA classifcation), a deep, low permeability soil with high plant available water capacity (Kear *et al.*, 1967; Craigie *et al.*, 2015). The Leeston site was characterized by a shallow water table at about 1 m below the soil surface.

Weather data were collected at a weather station located within 2 km from the experimental feld and provided daily minimum and maximum temperature, rainfall, solar radiation, and wind speed and relative humidity at 2 m.

During all experiments the grain, stem, chaf, and leaf dry weight at maturity, ear number and grain number, grain unit dry weight, and harvest index were determined. The total above ground dry biomass,

Sowing dates, sowing densities, total irrigation and N fertilization, and summary of average weather conditions from March to December for the feld

aSowing date not considered in this study because of signifcant lodging and diseases.

leaf number per stem and LAI were measured at Zadoks growth stage (Zadoks *et al*., 1974) 32 (stem elongation) and 65 (anthesis), except for the frst two growing seasons of the trial. For all but the frst growing season, several in-season measurements of the normalized diference vegetation index (NDVI; from Trimble Greenseeker (Trimble Agricul ture Division, CO, USA) measurements) and the fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (FIPAR; from Sunscan (Delta-T devices, Cambridge, UK) measurements), as well as the date of the 32, 65, and 90 Zadoks stages were available. FIPAR measurements were particularly useful for tracking in-season changes in canopy light inter ception and for supplementing information on biomass and LAI that were measured only at stem elongation and anthesis. The fertile stem biomass was obtained by dividing the fnal total above ground biomass by the ear number, as a measure of the above ground crop biomass per ear.

#### *Crop growth models*

Twenty-nine currently used process-based wheat crop models of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) Wheat group (<https://agmip.org/wheat/>) participated in this study and contributed to the MME output ([Supplementary Table S1)](http://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jxb/erac221#supplementary-data). Modelling groups were provided with daily weather data (minimum and maximum temperature, rainfall, solar radiation, wind speed at 2 m, relative air humidity at 2 m and average vapour pressure) and soil physico-chemical characteristics (soil water lower limit, drained upper limit, saturation, apparent bulk density, organic C and organic N con centration, and soil pH). Initial soil inorganic N amount was estimated for the upper 150 cm for each growing season, based on mineral ni trogen values measured in 2013 and 2014 in the upper 60 cm and 75 cm of soil, respectively. The soil was represented by three layers of equal thickness (50 cm) and the distribution of the total initial amount of inorganic N in each layer was estimated at 55%, 30%, and 15%, from the top layer to the bottom layer. Initial soil water content was esti mated at feld capacity. The same initial values of soil inorganic nitrogen and soil water content were used to initialize the simulations, regardless of sowing dates.

The models were calibrated with data measured during the 2014–2015 growing season, including a combination of four sowing dates and four sowing densities, for a total 16 diferent treatments. Supplied data were the mean of the four replicates. For each experiment, modellers were pro vided with phenological records: the date of beginning of stem extension (Zadoks 31) anthesis (Zadoks 65) and physiological maturity (Zadoks 87). In addition, the grain, stem, chaf, and leaf dry weight at maturity, ear number and grain number, grain unit dry weight, and harvest index were provided. Also, time series of measurements of total above ground dry biomass, leaf number per stem, and LAI were provided, as well as NDVI and FIPAR.

After calibration, simulations were conducted by each model for all combinations of sowing date, sowing density, and growing season [(Table 1](#page-3-0)), for a total of 50 simulations. All 29 models reported above ground bio mass at anthesis and maturity, grain yield, and harvest index, while LAI was reported by 28 models, grain dry weight and grain number by 15 models, and FIPAR by 13 models. The results are plotted as median and 25% and 75% quantiles of the measured and simulated variables. These values were estimated using bootstrap re-sampling.

#### *Crop growth model performance evaluation metrics*

<span id="page-3-1"></span>The interannual variability of grain yield (GY), was quantifed with the coefcient of variation (CV), which is the ratio of the standard deviation (σGY) to the mean (GY), as a percentage. The standard deviation is given by the square root of the sum of the squared diference between the grain yield and its mean, divided by the number of grain yield values *n* .

#### Page 5718 of 5729 | Dueri *et al.*

Copyedited by: OUP

$$\text{CV}_{\text{GY}} = \begin{array}{c} \text{\(\sigma_{\text{GY}}\)} \\ \hline \overline{\text{GY}} \end{array} \times 100 \tag{1}$$

$$
\sigma_{\rm GY} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(\rm{GY} - \rm{GY}\right)^{2}}{n}} \tag{2}
$$

The higher the coefcient of variation, the greater the level of dispersion around the mean.

The root mean square error (RMSE) is the standard deviation of the residuals and is calculated as the squared root of the mean squared diference between the observed (*O*) and the simulated (*S*) values and is given as:

$$\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(S_i - O_i\right)^2}{n}} \tag{3}$$

The model accuracy was quantifed using the relative RMSE (RRMSE), expressed as a percentage, which is useful to compare outputs with different units. RRMSE is obtained by dividing RMSE by the mean of the observations (*O*):

$$\text{RRMSE} = \frac{\text{RMSE}}{\overline{O}} \times 100\tag{4}$$

We consider that model accuracy is excellent if RRMSE<10%, good if 10%<RRMSE<20%, fair if 20%≤RRMSE<30%, and poor if RRMSE≥30% (Jamieson *et al.*, 1991).

#### *Statistical analyses*

Copyedited by: OUP

An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to test if year, sowing date, and sowing rate had signifcant main or interaction efects on grain yield. We considered only the Leeston trials, where both sowing date and rate were tested [(Table 1](#page-3-0)). The analysis was conducted for both simulations and measurements. The ANOVA of measured grain yield was performed using data from all four replicates as independent observations (32 measurements×4 replicates=128 independent observations). The ANOVA of the simulations was conducted considering that the grain yield output of each model can be considered as an independent variable (32 simulations×29 models=928 independent observations).
