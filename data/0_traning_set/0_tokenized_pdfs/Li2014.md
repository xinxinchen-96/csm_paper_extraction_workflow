## ABSTRACT

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer – Cropping System Model (DSSAT-CSM) using the CENTURY-based soil module to simulate longterm trends of grain yield, soil organic C (SOC) and soil organic N (SON) based upon 14-year data from a spring maize (*Zea mays* L.) and winter wheat (*Triticum aestivum* L.) cropping system study conducted in the Loess Plateau of Northwestern China. There were four treatments including no fertilizer (N0), 90 kg N ha−1 from urea (N90), 30 kg N ha−1 from straw plus 90 kg N ha−1 from urea (SN90), and 40 kg N ha−1 from cattle manure plus 90 kg N ha−1 from urea (MN90) selected in this study. The DSSAT-CSM showed a good to excellent agreement for simulating maize yields with normalized root mean square error (*nRMSE*) ≤ 19%, index of agreement (*d*) > 0.91 and modeling efficiency (*EF*) ≥ 0.56, and a moderate to good agreement for wheat yields with *nRMSE* ≤ 22%, *d* > 0.89 and *EF* > 0.46 for N90, SN90 and MN90 treatments. The model simulated SOC in the 0–20 cm depth for both SN90 and MN90 very well with *nRMSE* < 13% and *d* > 0.63 and moderately for N90 and N0. The simulated topsoil SON matched the measured data for N90, SN90 and MN90 very well with *nRMSE* < 7%, *d* > 0.77 and *EF* > 0.15, whereas the simulation for N0 was poor. Both maize wheat yields were found to be more sensitive to the fertilizer N rates in humid than drought soil conditions. The sensitivity of grain yields for either maize or wheat to generated growing season precipitation was affected by fertilizer N rate. The simulated soil nitrate-N (NO3-N) in soil profile and the NO3-N leaching below 150 cm increased with the increased fertilizer N rates as expected. The periods occurring high NO3-N leaching were along with drainage events mainly in the next fallow periods. Therefore, this study found that the DSSAT-CSM has a large potential to assess the impacts of various agricultural practices on crop growth, soil C and N dynamics in the semi-arid to semi-humid region of the Loess Plateau, and could contribute to selecting the optimum management practices.

# **2. Materials and methods**

#### *2.1. Long-term experimental data*

The data used in this study were collected from a long-term fertilizer experiment which was conducted from April 1979 to October 1992 at the Gaoping Agronomy Farm, Pingliang, Gansu province, northwestern China [(Fan et al., 2004, 2005a, 2005b, 2008; Liu](#page-13-13) [et al., 2010a, 2013a)](#page-13-13). The experimental field is located in the central part of the Shizi highland plateau (35°16′ N, 107°30′ E, elevation 1254 m) [(Fan et al., 2005a)](#page-13-17) which is located in the Loess Plateau. In the Chinese soil classification system, the soil group of the experimental field is dark loessial soil with silty loam textured top soil (0 to 20 cm) [(Fan et al., 2005a)](#page-13-17). This dark loessial soil is developed from Quaternary loess sediments classified as Mollisols in USDA soil taxonomy [(Li et al., 2013)](#page-13-18).

The details of the experimental design and crop management have been described by [Fan et al. (2004; 2005a; 2008)](#page-13-13) and [Liu et al.](#page-13-19) [(2013a),](#page-13-19) thus, only a review of information pertinent to this study is presented. There were six treatments arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications [(Fan et al., 2004,](#page-13-13) [2005a)](#page-13-13). For this study, four treatments were selected for comparison with the DSSAT-CSM model: (1) no fertilizer (N0), (2) 90 kg N ha−1 from urea (N90), (3) 30 kg N ha−1 from maize or wheat straw plus 90 kg N ha−1 from urea (SN90), (4) 40 kg N ha−1 from cattle manure plus 90 kg N ha−1 from urea (MN90).

In this experiment, the cropping systems were a 2-year spring maize (*Zea mays* L.) followed by a 4-year winter wheat (*Triticum aestivum* L.) rotation, with only one crop each year from 1979 to 1992 [(Table 1)](#page-2-0) [(Fan et al., 2004)](#page-13-13). Maize was seeded around 20 April each year with a density of around 5 plants m–2 and a 66.5 cm row spacing. Winter wheat was seeded with a row spacing of 14.7 cm at a 165 kg ha−1 seeding rate, which equaled to a 471 plants m–2 density using an average 1000-kernel weight of 35 g [(Zhou et al.,](#page-14-2) [2007)](#page-14-2). The planting times were around 20 September each year when wheat followed wheat, and in early October when wheat followed maize. Crops were harvested manually and the plants were

**Table 1** cut close to the ground and all harvested biomass were removed from the plots with the exception of SN90 treatment where wheat or maize straw containing 30 kg N ha−1 was returned.

In this experiment, the maize and wheat grain samples were collected at harvest, oven-dried at 70 °C for 48 hours, and then weighed for the period from 1979 to 1992 [(Fan et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2013a)](#page-13-13). Surface soil (0 to 20 cm) samples were also collected randomly during 1979 to 1991 fifteen days after harvest, and then soil organic C and total soil N concentrations were measured [(Fan et al., 2005a; Liu](#page-13-17) [et al., 2013a)](#page-13-17). The measured total soil N in the soil includes both organic N as well as inorganic N. At harvest, due to crop uptake, nitrate leaching, etc., the inorganic N concentrations were found to be very low in this field and, as a result, the total soil N was assumed to be primarily soil organic N [(Wu et al., 2003)](#page-13-20).

## *2.2. Weather data*

The weather data used in this study were from the Changwu weather station (35°12′ N, 107°48′ E, elevation 1207 m) which is located 33 km away from the Gaoping experimental site. These weather data were obtained from the China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System (available at http://cdc.cma.gov.cn/ cdc_en/home.do; user login is required). The weather data varied from temperate semi-arid to semi-humid with the average annual temperature ranging from 8.6 to 10.3 °C [(Fig. 1a)](#page-3-0), and the annual precipitation ranging from 323 to 822 mm from 1979 to 1992, and a majority of the precipitation occurring from June to September [(Fig. 1b, c)](#page-3-0). The precipitation for the spring maize growing seasons (i.e., April to September) ranged from 300 to 506 mm [(Fig. 1b)](#page-3-0), and for the winter wheat growing seasons (i.e., previous September to June) ranged from 190 to 500 mm [(Fig. 1b)](#page-3-0). For 1981 and 1987, the years in which wheat followed maize, the winter wheat growing seasons were from previous October to June.

# *2.3. Crop simulation*

# *2.3.1. Model input data*

In this study, the CERES-Maize and CERES-Wheat modules and the CENTURY-based soil module in DSSAT (version 4.5) [(Hoogenboom](#page-13-21) [et al., 2010)](#page-13-21) were used to conduct simulations. The model required input data include crop management, daily weather data, soil profile data, initial soil conditions and cultivar coefficients. The crop management data contain crop planting date and density, row space, tillage method and date, fertilization (inorganic and manure) dates and rates, and harvest date, etc. These crop management data were obtained from the published data for this field site as described by [Fan et al. (2004, 2005a, 2005b, 2008)](#page-13-13) and [Liu et al. (2010a, 2013a)](#page-13-22), and this information was summarized (Table 1). For the SN90 treatment, maize or wheat straw residue was cut to around 10 cm in length and then was returned to the soil after harvest, whereas the maize and wheat straw was removed from the plots for N0, N90 and MN90 treatments [(Fan et al., 2005a)](#page-13-17). The field was plowed to 23 cm depth in July after wheat harvest or in October after maize harvest except for the years in which wheat followed maize. For these years, i.e., 1980 and 1986, the fields were cultivated with a shallow disk after maize harvest and wheat was subsequently seeded [(Liu](#page-13-19) [et al., 2013a)](#page-13-19). The period between crop harvest and the next crop planting was set as fallow in the study. In addition, an atmospheric N deposition of 10 kg N ha−1 were included as an annual available N input for all the treatments at the beginning of each crop period [(Liu et al., 2010b)](#page-13-23). The initial soil conditions (i.e., soil water content, NH4-N and NO3-N contents by layers) were set based on report by [Wu et al. (2003).](#page-13-20)

The minimum daily weather data required to run the DSSAT model includes daily solar radiation (MJ m–2), daily maximum and minimum temperatures (°C) and daily precipitation (mm). These

daily weather data were collected from 1979 to 1992. The daily solar radiation was calculated from daily sunshine hours using the Weatherman program in DSSAT model [(Pickering et al., 1994)](#page-13-24).

The soil profile (0 to 150 cm) data were obtained from published data measured in Changwu Loess plateau with the same soil type by [Zhang and Liu (2005).](#page-14-3) The profile data included soil water lower limit, drained upper limit, saturation, saturated hydraulic conduct, bulk density, soil organic C, total N, soil clay, silt contents, etc. [(Table 2)](#page-4-0). These soil profile data were saved in DSSAT soil file.

To simulate soil organic C and N, we need to initialize the program with the field history (FLHST) and the C/N ratio parameters to support the DSSAT Century-based soil module [(Gijsman et al., 2002)](#page-13-5). In this study, the initial field soil fertility might be depleted as very little fertilizer was applied before the start of the experiment [(Fan](#page-13-16) [et al., 2008)](#page-13-16). Therefore, the FH301 which corresponds to an initially degraded field was selected as the FLHST. The measured initial topsoil SOC was 6.2 g kg−1 , total N was 0.95 g kg−1 [(Liu et al., 2013a)](#page-13-19) and the topsoil mineral N was less than 0.01 g kg−1 [(Wu et al., 2003)](#page-13-20), thus, the C/N ratio was around 6.6 in this experiment. Therefore, the soil C/N ratio in the DSSAT standard data file (i.e., SOMFX045.SDA) was initialized with the measured value 6.6 based on [Gijsman et al.](#page-13-5) [(2002).](#page-13-5)

## *2.3.2. Cultivar calibration*

The DSSAT crop cultivar coefficients control the crop growth stages which can vary with different weather data [(Jones et al., 2003)](#page-13-1). Therefore they must be calibrated under the optimum conditions (i.e., minimum stress in weather and nutrients) for the region [(Boote,](#page-13-25) [1999; Liu et al., 2011)](#page-13-25). In this study, the default maize cultivar 990002 (in MZCER045.CUL file), and default wheat cultivar IB1015 (in WHCER045.CUL file) were selected for calibrating new cultivars. The calibration was made using a 'Trial and Error' method by setting up a small change (i.e., ± 5%) of each parameter. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the simulated and measured grain yields was used to find the best matched coefficients. In addition to the grain yield, the phonological stages were also taken into account in the calibration of the cultivar coefficients. The simulated

phonological stages (e.g., emergence, grain fill and maturity days) under the calibrated cultivar coefficients were roughly in the same phonological stages as field crops in this region. The normal rainfall year 1985 was selected as the calibration year for the maize cultivar. A wet year 1983 and a normal year 1988 were selected as calibration years for the two wheat cultivars. All of the calibration was conducted using the N90 treatment. One maize cultivar and two wheat cultivars were calibrated, and the calibrated coefficients are listed in Table 3.

#### *2.3.3. Model runs and outputs*

The simulation was made under DSSAT Sequence Analysis program so that the soil nutrient and water dynamics could be continuously transferred from the beginning to the end of the simulation [(Thornton et al., 1994, 1995)](#page-13-7). Four management files (i.e., .SQX) were established for the respective four treatments based on the input data described above. The outputs can be readily visualized and statistically evaluated using the EasyGrapher graphical program [(Yang](#page-14-4) [and Huffman, 2004)](#page-14-4). In this study, we focus on evaluating the model performance by comparing the simulated grain yields, SOC and SON with respective measured values from the long-term experiment from 1979 to 1992.

# *2.3.4. Model evaluation statistics*

Different statistics address particular aspects of a model performance. In order to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of the DSSAT model performance, five deviation statistics were used

in this study, including mean error (*E*), root mean square error (*RMSE*), normalized *RMSE* (*nRMSE*), index of agreement (*d*) [(Willmott, 1982)](#page-13-26) and modeling efficiency (*EF*) [(Loague and Freeze,](#page-13-27) [1985; Yang et al., 2000)](#page-13-27). In addition, a paired-*t* test was used to test the significance of *E*. The regression between the simulated and measured grain yields was also carried out. The five deviation statistics were calculated using the equations below based on [Yang](#page-14-5) [et al. (2014):](#page-14-5)

$$E = \frac{\sum_{l=1}^{n} (S_l - M_l)}{n} \tag{1}$$

$$RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{l=1}^{n} \left(\mathbf{S}_{l} - \mathbf{M}_{l}\right)^{2}}{n}} \tag{2}$$

$$
\ln \text{RMSE} = \frac{\text{RMSE}}{\overline{\text{M}}} \times 100\tag{3}
$$

$$d = 1 - \frac{\sum_{l=1}^{n} \left( S_l - \overline{M}_l \right)^2}{\sum_{l=1}^{n} \left( \left| S_l - \overline{M} \right| + \left| M_l - \overline{M} \right| \right)^2} \tag{4}$$

$$EF = 1 - \frac{\sum_{l=1}^{n} (\mathbf{S}_l - \mathbf{M}_l)^2}{\sum_{l=1}^{n} \left(\mathbf{M}_l - \overline{\mathbf{M}}\right)^2} \tag{5}$$

where *Si* is the simulated value, *Mi* is the measured value, *n* is the number of values, and *M* is the average of the measured values.

The *RMSE* summarizes the average difference between observed and predicted values [(Willmott, 1982)](#page-13-26). The *nRMSE* shows the relative size of the average difference without units and this statistic is unbounded [(Willmott, 1982)](#page-13-26). For small sample datasets (e.g., *n* = 6, 8 or 13) that were used in this study, we consider *nRMSE* ≤ 15% as "good" agreement; 15–30% as "moderate" agreement; and ≥ 30% as "poor" agreement [(Liu et al., 2013b; Yang et al., 2013)](#page-13-28).

The index of agreement (*d*) (0 ≤ *d* ≤ 1) is intended to be a descriptive measure, and it is both a relative and bounded measure [(Willmott, 1982)](#page-13-26). As recommended by [Liu et al. (2013b),](#page-13-28) when *d* ≥ 0.9 this indicates "excellent" agreement; when 0.8 ≤ *d* < 0.9, then we consider this as "good" agreement; when 0.7 ≤ *d* < 0.8, then there is "moderate" agreement; and when *d* < 0.7 there is "poor" agreement between measured and predicted values.

#### *2.3.5. Model sensitivity analysis*

Sensitivity analysis is a fundamental tool in the building, use and understanding of simulation models as it could provide information regarding the behavior of the model including the identification of important model inputs (parameters or variables) [(Confalonieri et al.,](#page-13-29) [2010)](#page-13-29). In this study, the sensitivity analysis of grain yields and soil N dynamics to fertilizer N application levels was carried out by varying fertilizer N from 0 to 210 kg ha−1 with a 30 kg ha−1 interval for each year using the DSSAT-Sequence Analysis program. This way, the optimum N application rates for the maximum grain yields can be investigated. The corresponding soil nitrate-N leaching loss below crop rooting zone under different fertilizer N rates was also predicted. In addition, the sensitivity of maize and wheat yields to various weather conditions were investigated by creating a climate file (i.e., .CLI) using the measured 14-year weather data from 1979 to 1992. Then, based on the climate file, different weather data were generated using the internal weather generator by setting up 30 replications for 30 sequences. Thus, the simulated grain yields under 30 generated weather data sets for each sequence were analyzed for the N0 and N90 treatments.
