## a b s t r a c t

Previous yield gains in wheat have been achieved through increased expression of grain number per unit area, while fruiting efficiency has also been shown to explain improved grain number. However, combining a high grain number and weight in the same genotype is a difficult task in practical breeding. This study evaluated the progeny of a cross between two elite parents that contrast in grain number and grain weight, as a way to better understand how the two desired traits might be combined to achieve a significant boost in yield. The two parents are both high biomass elite spring wheat lines that achieve high yield through contrasting strategies: Bacanora achieves high grain number with a high density of relatively small spikes. Weebil has a lower density of larger spikes in which larger grain size is expressed. The specific objectives of this research were: (i) to evaluate grain yield performance of DH lines and parents over two seasons, (ii) to identify promising physiological traits explaining high yield performance and (iii) to determine whether these traits are also expressed at the low plant densities. Two experiments were carried out under field conditions in southern Chile where the highest yield potential of wheat has ever been recorded. In Exp. 1 the performance of the 105 spring wheat DH lines, their parents and a Chilean spring cultivar (Pandora-INIA) with similar phenology were assessed together. Results showed that it is possible to increase yield potential by combining high grain number and grain weight, thereby reducing the trade-off between both components. 42 and 50% of the DH lines showed transgressive segregation in S1 and S2, respectively. 3 and 4% of the DH lines yielded between 15,000 and 16,000 kg ha−1. Grain yield was highly correlated with above-ground biomass (R2 = 0.78, p < 0.0001 in S1 and R2 = 0.77, p < 0.0001 in S2) and grain number (R2 = 0.69, p < 0.0001 in S1 and R2 = 0.71, p < 0.0001 in S2), whereas no correlation was found with either harvest index or grain weight. In Exp. 2, the high-yielding DH lines selected from Exp. 1 showed on average 45% higher grain yield (p < 0.01) than the Chilean checks. Differences in yield between the DH lines and the checks were explained by grain number m−2, which was closely related to grain number spike−1 and fruiting efficiency. The latter trait was in line with faster post-anthesis spike dry matter accumulation, explaining in turn the higher radiation use efficiency of the selected DH lines recorded during this period. When comparing yield and its components at different plant densities, grain yield and both main yield components showed strong correlations between environments as a result of increased expression of grains spike−1 (p < 0.001) under low plant density that was able to offset the reduction in spike number m−2 (p < 0.001).

# **2. Materials and methods**

## 2.1. Field site description, treatments and experimental conditions

Two experiments were carried out on a Typic Hapludand soil at the experimental station of the Universidad Austral de Chile in Valdivia (39◦47 S, 73◦14 W). Exp. 1 was conducted in two growing seasons: 2008–2009 (S1) and 2009–2010 (S2); whereas Exp. 2 was carried out in 2010–2011. In Exp. 1 the performance of 105 spring wheat DH lines, their parental cultivars and a Chilean spring cultivar (Pandora-INIA), which is widely sown in the country, were assessed. In Exp. 2, the two highest yielding DH lines from Exp. 1 (one was selected in S1 and the other in S2, called hereafter DH1 and DH2 respectively) were compared under two plant densities with two high yielding Chilean cultivars released by two different breeding programs: Pandora-INIAfrom the NationalWheat Program, and Invento-BAER released by one ofthe mostimportant private-sector Chilean wheat breeders (Semillas Baer).

The DH population derived from the cross of a high number and high weight cultivars with similar grain yield and phenology was especially designed by Drs. Daniel Calderini and Matthew Reynolds to testthe abovementionedobjectives. The cross between Bacanora and Weebil was carried out in CIMMYT and the DH population was developed by Drs. John Snape and Simon Griffiths in the John Innes Centre (Norwich, UK). The two parents have a coefficient of parentage of 0.305, indicating that they are not close relatives. Both are high biomass elite spring wheat lines that achieve high yield through contrasting strategies: Bacanora produces high grain number with a high density of relatively small spikes. Weebil has a lower density of larger spikes in which larger grain size is expressed. Therefore, the main difference in yield components between Bacanora and Weebil is their high grain number and grain weight, respectively.

Exp. 1 was sown on August 23, 2008 (S1) and September 4, 2009 (S2). In both growing seasons the experiment was set in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Each block consisted of a continuous plot where every genotype was sown in three rows of 1.5 m long (0.15 m between rows), flanked by a row (0.15 m apart and 1.5 m long) of the local spring wheat Pandora INIA at each side and sown at a plant density of 350 plants m−2. In Exp. 2, four genotypes (DH1, DH2, Pandora-INIA and Invento-BAER) were sown on August 22, 2010 at two plant densities (350 plants m−2 with conventional plant distribution and at 44 plants m−2 with a squared arrangement, i.e. 15 cm × 15 cm). In Exp. 2 the design corresponded to a split-plot arrangement with three replications, where plant density was the main plot and the genotype the sub-plot. Plots of conventional density were 1.35 m wide and 2.0 m long and the ones of low density were squared plots of 1.5 by 1.5 m.

Exp. 1 was fertilized at sowing with 150 kg N ha−1, 300 kg P2O5 ha−1 and 150 kg K2O ha−1. An additional fertilization of 150 kg N ha−1 was applied at tillering in both seasons. Exp. 2 was fertilized at sowing with 200 kg N ha−1, 300 kg P2O5 ha−1 and 150 kg K2O ha−1, while 100 kg N ha−1 were added at tillering. All fertilizationdosages weredesignedbasedonsoil analysis guaranteeing that the crop would not suffer for any nutrient limitation. Diseases and insects were prevented or controlled by spraying recommended pesticides as required. Weeds were periodically removed by hand or by chemical applications at the rates recommended by their manufacturers.Water was supplied by irrigation when necessary to complement rainfall in all experiments, avoiding any risk of water stress.

## 2.2. Plant measurements

In Exp. 1, plants from 0.5 m were harvested from the central row of each experimental unit atmaturity and their organs were divided into three categories: spikes, leaf blades and stems plus sheath leaves. After drying for 48 h at 60 ◦C plant samples were weighed with an electronic balance (Mettler, Toledo XP205DR, Greifensee, Switzerland). Spikes were threshed and grain yield was recorded afterwards. Average grain weight was estimated using three random subsets of grains (100 grains each) per experimental unit. Grain number was calculated as the ratio between grain yield and average grain weight and HI was estimated as the ratio between grain yield and above-ground biomass.

In Exp. 2, phenology was recorded according to [Zadoks](#page-9-0) et [al.](#page-9-0) [(1974),](#page-9-0) following the average phenology of the plot (when 50% of

the shoots reached a certain developmental stage). Above-ground biomass, leaf area index and radiation interception were registered during the crop cycle. In plots sown at 350 plants m−2, biomass sampling was carried out at Z31, Z32, booting (Z45), heading (Z55), anthesis (Z65), three times during grain filling and at physiological maturity. Thus, 10 biomass samples per plot were harvested during the crop cycle, taking care of always leaving a row acting as border to protect the sampling area. Biomass samples were collected from inner rows of each plot in 0.5 m length, except at maturity, where 1.0 m was harvested. In plots sown at 44 plants m−2, samples of 0.9 m long (six plants) were collected at four time points;i.e. at Z31, Z32, anthesis (Z65) and physiological maturity. In both plant densities, samples were divided into blade leaves, stems plus sheath leaves and spikes when they were present. Individual spike weight was calculated by dividing the total spike weight in the sampling area by the number of spikes present. Leaf area was measured by an area-meter (LI 3100, LICOR, Lincoln, NE, USA) and leaf area index (LAI) was calculated by dividing the leaf area by the sampling surface area. At physiological maturity, grains were separated from other spike structures (chaff) by a blower, similar to in Exp. 1. After that, samples were oven-dried at 60 ◦C for 48 h and weighed to record grain yield with the same electronic balance than in Exp. 1. TGW was calculated counting all the grains in each sample and dividing total grain biomass by grain number.

Radiation intercepted by the crop was measured from 21 days after emergence to physiological maturity at each experimental unit in Exp. 2. Incident and radiation transmitted to ground level were measured twice a week using a 1 m long linear sensor (LI 191 S, Licor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). Transmitted radiation was measured on clear days at noon, by placing the line sensor in the in the left, center and right of the inter-row space between two central rows of each plot. The average of the three measurements was taken as transmitted radiation [(Slafer](#page-8-0) et [al.,](#page-8-0) [1990).](#page-8-0) After anthesis, transmitted radiation was measured along the green line, that is, by rising up the linear sensor as senescence progressed. Intercepted radiation (IR) was calculated as the ratio of the difference between incident and transmitted radiation to incident radiation. The dynamic of IR with time from emergence was estimated by fitting the experimental data to the following polynomial equation:

$$\mathbf{y} = a\mathbf{x}^5 + b\mathbf{x}^4 + c\mathbf{x}^3 + d\mathbf{x}^2 + e\mathbf{x} + f \tag{1}$$

where y is the IR and x represents the days after emergence. To calculate photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intercepted by the canopy day−1, the corresponding value of incident PAR was multiplied by the intercepted radiation of that day. Incident PAR was averaged every 15 min at the meteorological station of the Universidad Austral de Chile, approximately 200 m from the experimental plots. RUE was calculated as the slope of the linear regression of accumulated above-ground biomass against accumulated PAR intercepted (IPARa) between (a) Z21 and anthesis (RUE pre-anthesis) and (b) between anthesis and physiological maturity (RUE post-anthesis).

In Exp. 2, floral development was measured in DH1 and Invento-BAER in three main shoots per plot by harvesting the shoots once a week from terminal spikelet initiation to 10 days after anthesis. The developmental stage of all florets from one of the central spikelets was assessed using the semi-quantitative scale developed by[Waddington](#page-9-0) et [al.(1983),](#page-9-0) which recognizes different stages from W3 (glume primordia present) to W10 or fertile floret (style curve outwards and stigmatic branches spread wide, pollen grains on well-developed stigmatic hairs). Within each spikelet, florets were identified from proximalto distal positions, with F1 being the floret position closest to the rachis.

# 2.3. Statistical analysis

The effects of genotype (Exps. 1 and 2), season (Exp.1) and plant density (Exp. 2) on yield and associated traits were assessed by analysis of variance. The LSD test (5%) was employed to evaluate differences among treatments. Potential effects oftime to flowering on grain yield were assessed by a log-likelihood ratio test, where time to flowering was considered as a random term. Linear and quadratic regression analyses were used to evaluate the degree of association between variables.
