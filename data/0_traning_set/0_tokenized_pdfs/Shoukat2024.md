#### HIGHLIGHTS GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT

- The GCMs of CMIP6 projected an increase in temperatures and precipitation from 2021–2100, with the peak rise in 2081–2100.
- By 2100, forecasts had predicted a rise in maximum temperatures of 3.19 ◦C, minimum temperatures of 3.07◦C, and precipitation by 23%.
- Increased temperatures, and precipitation variations reduced the winter wheat growing season, grain number and grain yield.
- Adaptation strategies, such as adjusting planting times, optimizing nitrogen use, and enhancing irrigation, positively impacted grain yield.
- Increased CO2 levels and adaptation strategies can effectively mitigate the adverse warming impacts on grain yields.

# ABSTRACT

*CONTEXT:* Climate change profoundly affects agriculture through increased occurrences of extreme weather events, directly affecting crop growth and food security. The North China Plain (NCP), a significant region for winter wheat production, faces challenges from the changing climate, which could threaten agricultural output and sustainability.

*OBJECTIVE:* This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a warming climate, fluctuating precipitation, and rising CO2 levels on winter wheat production in the NCP. Additionally, it developed adaptation strategies, such as modifying the timing of planting and adjusting irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer levels, to mitigate the negative impacts of a changing climate on grain production.

*METHODS:* Using the DSSAT CROPSIM CERES-Wheat and NWheat models, this study incorporated baseline climate data from 2001 to 2020 and future climate projections from 12 GCMs under the CMIP6 framework. The

evaluation was segmented into four future terms (terms 1 to 4) spanning from 2021 to 2100, under two societal development scenarios known as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs): SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5. *RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:* The projections indicated an increase in temperature and precipitation over the century, with the most substantial changes under the SSP5–8.5 scenario. Term 1 (2021–2040) forecasts predicted mild temperature increases (0.89 ◦C increase in average maximum temperature, 0.74 ◦C in average minimum temperature) and an 8% increase in precipitation. Term 4 (2081–2100) projections indicated a more severe climate impact, with maximum temperatures rising by 3.19 ◦C, minimum temperatures by 3.07 ◦C, and seasonal precipitation increasing by 23%. These climatic changes are expected to reduce the winter wheat growing season by 4–17%, decrease grain numbers by 3–21%, and reduce yield by 4–20% compared to the baseline. However, the increase in CO2 from terms 1 to 4 could enhance grain yield by 4–30% under SSP5–8.5, indicating a complex interaction between climatic factors and crop productivity. This study showed that adaptation strategies, including adjusting planting times (early October), irrigation levels (300–400 mm), and nitrogen fertilizer application (250–300 kg ha− 1 ), can effectively minimize the negative impacts of warming on grain yield. *SIGNIFICANCE:* This study underscores the critical need for immediate and effective adaptation strategies to address the impact of climate change on agriculture. By adjusting agricultural practices, the negative effects on

winter wheat production in the NCP can be mitigated, thereby contributing to regional food security in the face of ongoing climate challenges.

# **2. Materials and methods**

#### *2.1. Field experiments for modeling studies*

The Zhuozhou Experimental Station of China Agricultural University, located at 39◦27′N latitude, 115◦5′E longitude, and 42 m above mean sea level in Baoding, Hebei, China, served as the site for field experiments conducted throughout the periods of 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 (Fig. 1). The experimental farm was situated in a semihumid continental region commonly associated with a temperate monsoon climate zone. The NCP experiences notable variations in precipitation throughout the year, with the majority of the average annual rainfall (550 mm) occurring during the summer season, accounting for 70–80% of the total. Precipitation alone fulfills around 25–40% of the water needs for winter wheat growth in the area. To offset a deficiency in rainfall, it is imperative to provide irrigation water to winter wheat to sustain ideal grain yields. The weather data, which includes the maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation, were gathered within a 100-m radius of the measurement site using a HOBO U30 automated weather station manufactured by Onset Computer Co., located in Massachusetts, USA (Hui et al., [2022](#page-16-0)) ([Fig.](#page-3-0) 2). Based on the USDA soil texture triangle, the predominant soil type is sandy. The soil layer from 0 to 40 cm has a maximum accessible water content (AWC) of 0.16 cm3 cm− 3 . Prior to wheat sowing, an analysis was conducted to assess the physicochemical properties of the soil. ([Table](#page-3-0) 1).

#### *2.2. Experimental design and treatments*

The winter wheat variety Nongda 212 was planted on October 12, 2020, and October 10, 2021, over the course of the two-year experimental period. Winter wheat was sown at a seeding depth of 4 cm, row spacing of 15 cm, and seeding rate of 270 kg ha− 1 . The experiment was conducted using an irrigation and fertigation system equipped with a center pivot. The trial site encompassed an area of 1.03 ha and employed a three-span center pivot irrigation and fertigation system produced by Modern Agricultural Equipment Co., Ltd., based in Beijing, China. The third span measures 50 m, the overhang extends for 15 m, the first span is 37 m long, the second span measures 38 m, and the center pivot has a length of 140 m (Hui et al., [2022](#page-16-0)).

The experiment was carried out using a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three repetitions. Over the course of the two-year winter wheat trials, a total of five different treatments, including the application of nitrogen (N), were conducted. The specifics of these treatments are shown in [Table](#page-3-0) 2. Urea, containing 46% nitrogen, was used as the main nitrogen fertilizer. Throughout the two-year experimental period, nitrogen fertilizer was applied at different stages of growth, specifically during the regreening (169 and 171 days after sowing in the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 growing seasons, respectively), jointing (195 and 197 days after sowing in the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 growing seasons, respectively), and anthesis (210 and 211 days after sowing in the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 growing seasons, respectively) phases. Among the other growth stages, the regreening stage in winter wheat is a crucial phase that occurs after the overwintering stage and before the rising and jointing stages. Throughout the first growth period, 270 mm of irrigation water was provided at

several stages of development, including overwintering (30 mm), regreening (40 mm), early jointing (30 mm), late jointing (35 mm), heading (30 mm), anthesis (35 mm), early filling (35 mm), and late filling (35 mm). in the second season, irrigation was excluded at the late filling stage due to precipitation. Throughout the crop growth period, further field management activities were carried out in compliance with the established local requirements. In both growing seasons, the crops were harvested on June 7, 2021, and June 8, 2022.

#### *2.3. Crop modeling (calibration, and evaluation)*

# *2.3.1. Description of the DSSAT wheat simulation models*

The CSM of the DSSAT is a model that focuses on processes and operates based on mechanisms [(Jones](#page-16-0) et al., 2003). It includes dynamic crop growth simulation models for many types of crops. Recently, additional capabilities have been integrated into DSSAT to enhance its application ([Hoogenboom](#page-16-0) et al., 2023). The present study employed the CROPSIM CERES (CSCER) Wheat (Zhang et al., [2023a)](#page-17-0) and NWheat models from the latest edition of DSSAT v4.8. The main improvements in the current version involve transitioning to a four-digit year format for the weather files. This shift allows for greater flexibility in simulating historical weather data before 1900, as well as future climate change projections for 2100 and beyond. The defined year in the weather file was selected as the corresponding year for the simulation ([Hoogenboom](#page-16-0) et al., [2023)](#page-16-0).

Incorporating the CROPSIM CERES-Wheat and NWheat models into the DSSAT version 4.8 framework involved integrating these models into a comprehensive system. Chosen for their effectiveness in climate change and food security research, these models add significant capabilities to the DSSAT, which features multiple modules including soil, Crop template, weather, and a module for managing light and water competition among soil, plants, and atmosphere ([Jones](#page-16-0) et al., 2003). The DSSAT-CERES-Wheat model, created by [Ritchie](#page-17-0) (1985), is particularly noted for its wide use in crop modeling, stemming from innovations by Ritchie and colleagues in the 1970. This model's ability to regulate growth and development through temperature and daylight, coupled with the radiation use efficiency (RUE) technique, enables accurate simulation of both spring and winter wheat phenologies, considering the impact of vernalization ([Ritchie,](#page-17-0) 1985). The incorporation of NWheat into the DSSAT was achieved through modifications to the APSIM-NWheat ([Asseng](#page-16-0) et al., 2004) model by Kassie et al. [(2016)](#page-16-0). The NWheat model was derived from the CROPSIM CERES-Wheat model. The dataset used in the NWheat model was similar to that of CROPSIM CERES-Wheat, but with some differences. These differences include the addition of supplementary cultivar coefficients for calibration ([Kheir](#page-16-0) et al., [2019)](#page-16-0). Furthermore, this model has been tested globally across diverse agro-climatic and agronomic settings ([Kassie](#page-16-0) et al., 2016; [Osman](#page-17-0) et al., [2020)](#page-17-0).

# *2.3.2. Model calibration and evaluation*

Calibration is the process of fine-tuning the genetic coefficients for

<span id="page-4-0"></span>each model and cultivar to precisely reflect the observed outputs in a specified research area (Timsina and [Humphreys,](#page-17-0) 2006). The essential input dataset for model execution consists of local daily meteorological data covering the entire wheat cultivation period, soil physical and chemical data, crop management data, observed data collected during experimental trials, and crop genetic traits ([Shoukat](#page-17-0) et al., 2022).

Model calibration was performed using winter wheat crop data from the second growing season (2021− 2022), specifically from a non-stress treatment in which 321 kg ha− 1 of N fertilizer (N321) was applied, which produced maximum yield compared with the other treatments ([Si](#page-17-0) et al., [2021](#page-17-0); [Yasin](#page-17-0) et al., 2022). This data set was selected to establish a robust baseline for the model under optimal growth conditions. To evaluate the model, we used crop data from both the first (2020− 2021) and second (2021–2022) growing seasons under various treatments that were not included in the calibration process ([Shoukat](#page-17-0) et al., 2022). This approach ensured that the predictive accuracy of the model was tested against independent datasets, enhancing the validity of the model across different treatment conditions and temporal variations. This dual-phase process ensured that the model could reliably predict winter wheat responses under varying agricultural practices and environmental conditions. NWheat calibration involves manually adjusting the genetic parameters within their known ranges based on genotype data until the values closely match the observed data. On the other hand, CERES-Wheat calibration used trial-and-error with Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methods in DSSAT ([Ahmed](#page-16-0) et al., 2016). The genetic parameters of the two calibrated models are listed in Table 3.

Model performance was quantified using the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), normal root mean square error (nRMSE), and Willmott index of agreement (d) ([Shoukat](#page-17-0) et al., 2022).

$$\text{MAPE} = \frac{1}{n} \times 100 \times \sum_{l=1}^{n} \left( \frac{\text{Oi} - \text{Si}}{\text{Oi}} \right) \tag{1}$$

$$\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\text{n}} \sum_{l=1}^{n} \left(\mathbf{S}_{l} - \mathbf{O}_{l}\right)^{2}} \tag{2}$$

$$\text{nRMSE} = \sqrt{\sum_{l=1}^{n} \frac{(St - Out)^2}{n}} \times \frac{100}{\overline{O}} \tag{3}$$

$$\mathbf{d} = \mathbf{1} - \frac{\sum_{l=1}^{n} (\mathbf{O}_l - \mathbf{S}_l)^2}{\sum_{l}^{n} \left( |\mathbf{O}_l - \mathbf{O}| + |\mathbf{S}_l - \mathbf{O}| \right)^2} \tag{4}$$

#### *2.4. Sixth phase of coupled model intercomparison project*

*i*=1

The assessment of climate change is essential for understanding the climate system and addressing socioeconomic hazards and mitigation strategies (O'Neill et al., [2017](#page-17-0)). The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) highlights the CMIP6 ensemble's potential for exploring climate change mechanisms and improving global climate predictions [(IPCC,](#page-16-0) [2021)](#page-16-0). The CMIP6 includes the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP), utilizing new simulations based on concentration pathways specified by [Tebaldi](#page-17-0) et al. (2020) to project future climate conditions. This initiative advances General Circulation Models (GCMs) by integrating updated Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and greenhouse gas emission data, enhancing our capability to predict future climatic scenarios (Li et al., [2024;](#page-16-0) Iqbal et al., [2021](#page-16-0)). SSPs are vital for addressing impact, vulnerability, adaptation, and mitigation issues. They offer five themes representing various socioeconomic progress pathways, including moderate development, regional competitiveness, disparities, sustainable growth, and fossil fuel reliance ([Riahi](#page-17-0) et al., [2017)](#page-17-0). These scenarios, particularly SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5, are crucial

for assessing climate impacts and adaptations. The selection of SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 scenarios for this study offers insights into a broad spectrum of potential futures. SSP2–4.5, the "middle-of-the-road" scenario, focuses on sustainability with moderate socioeconomic development and reduced emissions, ideal for evaluating balanced growth and environmental strategies. SSP5–8.5, the "business-as-usual" scenario, reflects a high-growth trajectory with minimal mitigation efforts, crucial for assessing the upper limits of climate impacts. These scenarios enable a thorough analysis of climate risks and adaptation measures across different development paths (O'Neill et al., [2017)](#page-17-0). These scenarios enable researchers to evaluate the effects of climate change and the necessary adaptive measures under different levels of socioeconomic development and environmental change (O'Neill et al., [2020](#page-17-0)).

#### *2.5. Global climate models and statistical downscaling*

The China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System (CMDSSS) ([http://cdc.cma.gov.cn,](http://cdc.cma.gov.cn) retrieved on November 5, 2022) provided historical meteorological data for a period of 20 years that including daily precipitation, solar radiation, and maximum and minimum air temperatures (Li et al., [2023](#page-16-0)). The World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) websites ([https://esgf-node.](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/) [llnl.gov/search/cmip6/,](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/) retrieved on November 10, 2022) were used to obtain the 12 GCMs' raw climate data for maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation for the years 2021–2100 under the SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 scenarios ([Shoukat](#page-17-0) et al., 2022; [Zhang](#page-17-0) et al., [2023a)](#page-17-0). The same datasets were downloaded using the same 'r1i1p1f1' variant (first realization, first initialization, first physics, and first forcing). The selection of these 12 GCMs was based on their climatological characteristics as well as their representation of different regions [(Gul](#page-16-0) et al., [2020)](#page-16-0) (Table 4). The climatic data from 12 GCMs, specifically pertaining to maximum and minimum temperatures as well as precipitation, were analyzed under two different scenarios: SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5. These scenarios are further divided into four distinct terms:1 (2021–2040), 2 (2041–2060), 3 (2061–2080), and 4 (2081–2100). The purpose of this analysis was to assess the impact of climate change on these four terms.

[Ashfaq](#page-16-0) et al. (2022) found that although some CMIP6 GCMs have a horizontal grid spacing of half a degree, most of them do not have the required resolution (*>*1◦ horizontal grid spacing) to adequately assess regional and local-scale mitigation and adaptation solutions. Therefore, it is crucial to utilize downscaling techniques to improve the geographical resolution of anticipated climate change data. Statistical downscaling approaches are frequently used to obtain precise regional data at a more refined scale (Ur [Rahman](#page-17-0) et al., 2018). Statistical downscaling involves the examination of large-scale atmospheric factors, such as circulation patterns, in connection with climatic surface variables ([Salehnia](#page-17-0) et al., 2019). Downscaling can be used to bridge the gap between climatic outputs and the data requirements of different agricultural and hydrological models. This approach enables the evaluation of the impact of climate change on crop productivity and food

security at local and site-specific levels. The study utilized the SD-GCM v2.0 (Statistical Downscaling of General Circulation Models) software ([Shoukat](#page-17-0) et al., 2022; [Salehnia](#page-17-0) et al., 2019). The software permitted the downscaling of CMIP6 model climate data on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis under SSP scenarios, making it highly valuable for its application. In our investigation, we utilized the delta method for statistical downscaling, which is a commonly used approach for downscaling GCM outputs. Owing to its straightforward implementation and intrinsic comprehensibility, this strategy is often recognized as the most efficient.

#### *2.6. Projections of climate change impact on winter wheat production*

After calibrating and validating the models, we used the calibrated DSSAT CROPSIM CERES-Wheat and NWheat models to simulate the phenology of winter wheat, including the number of days to anthesis and maturity, grain number, and grain yield (Zhang et al., [2023a](#page-17-0)). The calibration treatment, encompassing all management practices, such as sowing, fertilization, and irrigation, was utilized to assess the impact of climate change ([Yasin](#page-17-0) et al., 2022). This was accomplished by employing the reference period (2001− 2020) and analyzing future meteorological data (maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation) from 12 GCMs under the SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 scenarios. An investigation was conducted to analyze the phenology, grain numbers, and grain yield of winter wheat in the NCP across four successive periods: Term 1 (2021–2040), Term 2 (2041–2060), Term 3 (2061–2080), and Term 4 (2081–2100). This investigation employed the DSSAT CROPSIM CERES-Wheat and NWheat models in seasonal analysis tools. The current study examined the expected patterns of daily maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation, specifically within the framework of the SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 scenarios. It was presumed that all the other climatic factors remained consistent. Other researchers have utilized similar approaches in their investigations [(Ur](#page-17-0) [Rahman](#page-17-0) et al., 2018; [Yasin](#page-17-0) et al., 2022). The CERES-Wheat and NWheat models were used to create weather datasets using daily historical climate data from 2001 to 2020. In addition, we used daily climate data projections from the GCMs for the SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 scenarios. These projections were used for four specific time periods, referred to as terms 1, 2, 3, and 4.

The equation employed in this study assesses the impact of climate variability on winter wheat yield (Ur [Rahman](#page-17-0) et al., 2018).

$$
\Delta Y = \left(\frac{\text{Si} - \text{Oi}}{\text{Oi}}\right) \times 100\tag{5}
$$

In the given equation, ΔY represents the alteration in grain yield, Si denotes the mean anticipated yield in the future, and Oi is the mean yield during the baseline period.

# *2.7. Projected CO2 concentrations impact on winter wheat grain yield*

The CO2 concentrations projected under the SSP2–4.5 scenario were 460, 522, 575, and 601 ppm for terms 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, according to IPCC-AR6 ([IPCC,](#page-16-0) 2021). Similarly, the CO2 concentrations associated with the SSP5–8.5 scenario were 476, 603, 804, and 1067 ppm for the same terms. These projections were subsequently modified using the environmental modification seasonal analysis tool of the calibrated CROPSIM CERES-Wheat and NWheat models. The EC-Earth3 GCM was chosen to assess the influence of CO2 on the winter wheat grain yield. It demonstrated the highest level of agreement with other GCMs in terms of increasing maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as precipitation, as a comparable methodology was employed by ur Rahman et al. (2018). The baseline climate data for the current study comprised historical climate data from 2001 to 2020. The DSSAT model considers a default CO2 concentration of 380 ppm as the baseline level. Multiple studies have utilized similar approaches to investigate the impact of CO2 concentrations on crop productivity within representative concentration pathway (RCPs) scenarios (Ur [Rahman](#page-17-0) et al., 2018). The study evaluated winter wheat grain production under the SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 scenarios, which are based on different CO2 concentrations, with the baseline CO2 concentration.

# *2.8. Sensitivity analysis to temperature changes and exploring adaptive management scenarios in a warming climate*

The sensitivity analysis of winter wheat production to temperature changes was conducted using the DSSAT CROPSIM-CERES Wheat and NWheat models, incorporating an environmental modification tool ([Ishaque](#page-16-0) et al., 2023). The baseline climate data from 2001 to 2020 served as the foundation for this analysis. Calibration treatments, which included comprehensive management practices such as sowing, fertilization, and irrigation, were applied to assess the impact of temperature variations on winter wheat production. We adjusted the maximum and minimum temperatures in increments of 1, 2, 3, and 4 ◦C using the environmental modification tool in both models. Four distinct treatments, ranging from 1 ◦C to 4 ◦C, were designed to evaluate the sensitivity of winter wheat to each incremental increase in baseline temperature. This methodology mirrors the approaches used in previous studies to assess the effects of increasing temperatures on crop production (e.g., Ur [Rahman](#page-17-0) et al., 2018; [Ahmad](#page-16-0) et al., 2020).

This study explored adaptation strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of warming climate on winter wheat grain yield for the period 2021 to 2040, using the well-calibrated DSSAT CROPSIM-CERES Wheat and NWheat models (Ur [Rahman](#page-17-0) et al., 2018; [Yasin](#page-17-0) et al., 2022). The analysis utilized a 20-year dataset from the Term 1 of the EC-Earth3 GCM under SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 scenarios. This study assessed the impact of different sowing dates, N fertilizer rates, and irrigation levels under Term 1 on winter wheat grain yield. Various irrigation levels (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 mm) and N fertilizer rates (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, and 400 kg ha− 1 ) were assessed, along with a range of sowing dates from September 24 to November 12, spaced weekly. This included analyzing the optimal sowing date of early October, as recommended for the NCP region ([Wang](#page-17-0) et al., 2012). Winter wheat sowing in early October and application of 300 mm irrigation and 300 kg ha− 1 N fertilizer were considered traditional practices in the NCP ([Jia](#page-16-0) et al., [2014](#page-16-0); Fang et al., [2010;](#page-16-0) [Wang](#page-17-0) et al., 2012). Irrigation water was utilized at various developmental stages, including overwintering, regreening, early jointing, late jointing, heading, anthesis, and early filling stages. The initial dose of N fertilizer was placed as the basal dose, while the remaining N fertilizer was later added as a top dressing at various growth stages, such as regreening, jointing, and anthesis. The grain yield was then compared under various irrigation levels, nitrogen fertilizer rates, and sowing dates. Based on the observed maximum grain yield, optimal adaptation strategies are suggested for a warmer climate.
