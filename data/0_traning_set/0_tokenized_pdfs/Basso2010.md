# abstract

Appropriate nitrogen management is one of the main challenges of agricultural production and for the environment. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficiency of crop N uptake in a longterm wheat crop in a Mediterranean environment of Southern Italy, and to identify optimal N rate for reasonable economic returns and minimum nitrate leaching using SALUS crop simulation model.

The study was part of a long-term monoculture wheat system that started in 1991/1992 season, with two levels of nitrogen (0 and 90 kg N ha−1). Simulations of the treatment with no nitrogen (0 N) and 90 kg N ha−1 (90 N) were performed using the SALUS crop model for wheat. The model was tested against measurements of harvested grain yield, final N uptake, soil water content and total soil N. Long-term simulation over 56 years showed that grain yield median value was 3435 kg ha−1 for 0 N and 3876 kg ha−1 for 90 N. Simulation scenarios with different N rates (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 kg N ha−1) showed that yield response was higher for 120 N (3528 kg ha−1), with the 60 and 90 N yields giving the same response, 3010 and 3054 kg ha−1, respectively. The most profitable treatments were 120 N (302 Euro ha−1), followed by the 60 N (220 Euro ha−1). The simulation results showed that nitrate leaching was higher for the N rate of 120 and 180 with a mean annual value of 49 and 81 kg ha−1, respectively. Results suggest that in such environment 60 kg N ha−1 can be the most appropriate as an N fertilization management due to the best trade-off between leaching and economic. Since N fertilization rates are linked to nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and N leaching, a trade-off between N fertilization rates profit and grain yield should be thought as way to reduce environmental pollution while keeping productivity and profit. The adoption of simulation models to approximate the best N rate for durum wheat in rainfed Mediterranean environment proved to be a useful tool for supporting management decisions through quantifying the temporal variability related to weather uncertainty as it influences on the yield and nutrient dynamics. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

# **2. Materials and method**

# 2.1. Site description and crop management

The field study was carried out at the Cereal Research Centre, Foggia, Italy (41◦28N, 15◦32E; elev. 75 m). The study was part of a long-term monoculture wheat system that started in 1991/1992 season, with two levels of nitrogen, 0 kg N ha−1 (0 N) and 90 kg N ha−1 (90 N). The experimental design consisted of two large plots, separated from each other by 5 m of bare soil. One plot received 90 kg N ha−1 as a split application for 17 years; one application at sowing with 25 kg N ha−1 as diammonium phosphate and the other at end of tillering with 65 kg N ha−1 as urea. The second plot had not received N for 17 years. Each plot was divided into three sub-plots (each 6 by 20 m). Inside each sub-plot, destructive and non-destructive measurements of crop and soil properties were collected at five different square meter areas. The sowing time window of durum wheat in the study area was between mid-November and mid-December. Durum wheat (Triticum Durum, Desf.; cv. Ofanto) was sown on 28 December 2006 with a row spacing of 17 cm on a clay-loamy soil according to the USDA particle-size distribution limits. In 2006/2007 a detailed sampling scheme was implemented, with measurements made at stem elongation (DC 30), flowering (DC 65), and harvest. Leaf Area Index (LAI) was collected through non-destructive measurements by using a portable [LI-COR LAI 2000](#page-6-0) (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) on five points inside each sub-plot. Above-ground crop biomass was determined after drying the fresh samples in an oven at 105 ◦C. Grain weight (kg ha−1) was determined and other yield components measured were number of spikes/m2, spike length, number of spikelets per spike and number of kernel per spike. Grain weight data for this experiment were available only for some of the years of the experiment.

Crop total nitrogen (g kg−1), crop nitrate-N, and soil N (total N, ammonium-N and nitrate-N) were analysed by a private laboratory. From the final protein content, the grain N concentration was determined by dividing protein content by 5.7 as reported by [Tkachuk](#page-6-0) [(1969)](#page-6-0) and the N content in straw and chaff was assumed to be 1.5% [(Ryan et al., 2009).](#page-6-0)

The crop N uptake was calculated bymultiplying the total aboveground biomass by the N%. Crop N uptake was available for five years, from growing season 2002/2003 until 2006/2007.

# 2.2. Soil sampling

Soil samples were collected at the beginning of the growing season, and at flowering in each block for soil chemical analysis. Before sowing soil samples were take to determine texture using hydrometer method [(Klute and Dirkens, 1986),](#page-6-0) soil N with the Kjedahl method, organic C with the [Walkley–Black (1934)](#page-6-0) method and bulk density with the method described by [Blake and Hartge (1986); a](#page-6-0)nd for those determinations soil samples were made at five depths (0–10, 10–30, 30–50, 50–80, 80–120 cm).

At flowering, total N was determined with the Kjedahl method. Soil N was measured to 60 cm depth. Soil water content was measured at 60 cm using the Time Domain Refractometry (TDR) technique for the following dates, 12 February 2007, 28 February 2007, 6 April 2007.

# 2.3. Crop growth model

We used SALUS model to simulate the wheat and fallow rotation adopted in the study. The SALUS model (System Approach to Land Use Sustainability; [Basso, 2000; Basso et al., 2006; Senthilkumar](#page-5-0) [et al., 2009)](#page-5-0) is designed to simulate continuous crop, soil, water, and nutrient conditions under different management strategies for multiple years. The model time step is daily and for each simulation run a different number of management strategies can be run simultaneously. This allows the user to compare the effects of each management strategy on crop and soil conditions under the same weather sequence. Model assessments provide a framework whereby the interaction between different areas under different management practices can be compared.

The components run daily for each management strategy are water balance, soil organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorous balances, heat balance, plant growth and development, and the specific management practice.

The soil water balance module is based on that used in the CERES models [(Ritchie and Otter, 1985) b](#page-6-0)ut it differs in the calculation of infiltration, drainage, evaporation and runoff [(Suleiman and](#page-6-0) [Ritchie, 2003; Ritchie et al., 2009).](#page-6-0) In SALUS, a simplified time-toponding (TP) concept is used instead of the runoff and infiltration calculations based on the SCS curve numbers.

The soil organic matter (SOM) and nitrogen module is derived from Century model [(Parton et al., 1988)](#page-6-0) but with a number of modifications incorporated. Organic matter and N mineralization/immobilization are simulated from three SOM pools (active, slow and passive) which vary in their turnover rates and characteristics C:N ratios. There are two crop residue/fresh organic matter pools (structural and metabolic), for representing recalcitrant and easily decomposable residues, based on residue lignin and N content. A surface active SOM pool associated with the surface residue pools was added to improve simulation of conservation tillage systems and perennial crops.

The soil phosphorous (P) model incorporates inorganic and organic P dynamics. Inorganic P is divided into three pools (i) labile; (ii) active; (iii) stable [(Daroub et al., 2000).](#page-6-0)

Crop growth modules are based on the CERES and IBSNAT ([Ritchie and Otter, 1985; IBSNAT, 1993)](#page-6-0) families which were originally developed for single years and monoculture simulations. In SALUS the models have been restructured into crop growth modules linked to the soil water, nutrient and management sub-models. Currently, SALUS crop modules include wheat, and maize. Phasic development is function of environmental variables such as degree days, photoperiod, and variety-specific genetic coefficients.

Carbon assimilation and dry matter production are a function of potential rates (which are influenced by light interception and crop growth potential which is variety-specific) which are then reduce according to water and/or N limitations. The main external inputs required for the crop growth routines are the genetic (variety-specific) coefficients and daily solar radiation as a driving variable.

Modules for other crops in SALUS are done through a process similar to the ones used in EPIC and CROPSYST [(Stöckle et al., 2003)](#page-6-0) whereby the LAI pattern of a crop is input to provide a pattern of growth for a crop to intercept radiation, accumulate biomass and arrive at a yield through use of harvest index inputs.

The weather data used by the model included daily values of incoming solar radiation (MJ m−2 day−1), maximum and minimum temperature (◦C) and rainfall (mm). The measured weather was provided by a meteorological station sited near the experimental field for 56 years. Soil input data (sand, silt, and clay content, bulk density, organic carbon) were determined after collecting soil samples at five soil depth layers (0–10, 10–30, 30–50, 50–80, 80–120 cm) with a composite sampling scheme using an undisturbed soil core sampler. Soil water limits were calculated using the procedure suggested by [Ritchie et al. (1999)](#page-6-0) (Table 1).

The model performance was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE):

$$\text{RMSE} = \left[ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\mathbf{y}_i - \mathbf{\hat{y}}_i)^2 \right]^{1/2} \tag{1}$$

where yi are the observed measurements, yˆi the simulated predictions and n is the number of comparisons. In addition, the relative error (R.E.) with respect to the observed mean, which compares how incorrect the simulation mean is with respect to observed mean, is calculated as follows:

$$\text{relative error} \left( \% \right) = \frac{|\text{Sim} - \text{Obs}|}{\text{Obs}} \times 100 \tag{2}$$

where Sim are the simulated mean values, Obs are the observed mean values.

### 2.4. Model testing

The model was tested against measurements of harvested grain yield, final N uptake, soil water content and total soil N, for the 0 and 90 N treatments. In addition the model was tested against 29 years of measured grain yield for the same wheat cultivar harvested in the experimental station. Measured data were available only for some of the experimental years (1991–2008). The model was tested with data available for the following years: yield data (1991/1992; 1992/1993; 1995/1996; 1998/1999; 2002/2003; 2003/2004; 2004/2005; 2005/2006; 2006/2007); final N uptake (2002/2003; 2003/2004; 2004/2005; 2005/2006); soil N (1991/1992; 1993/1994; 1994/1995; 1995/1996; 1996/1997; 2006/2007); and volumetric soil water content was tested with data from the growing season 2006/2007 and for the following dates (12 February 2007, 28 February 2007, 6 April 2007). The model was also tested for the major growth stages, stem elongation, anthesis and harvest for the growing season 2006/2007.

#### 2.5. Simulation scenarios

The model was run in a continuous mode accounting for the soil N dynamic of the off-season fallow period. Six level of N (no N added, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 kg N ha−1) with no supplemental irrigation selected.

# 2.6. Economic analysis

For each simulation scenario the approximated net income was calculated by subtracting from the assumed price of the grain (multiplying grain yield per its current market price) the production costs, which include fertilizer costs, ploughing, sowing (that include operational costs plus seeds costs), weeds and pest control and harvest. The costs of fertilizer, agronomic practice and grain price have been obtained from the Italian farmer's association [(www.coldiretti.it)](http://www.coldiretti.it/) and the Italian Bureau of Statistic [(www.istat.it)](http://www.istat.it/).

The statistical analysis of variances (ANOVA) was performed with GENSTAT 10th edition [(Lawes Agricultural Trust, 2007).](#page-6-0)
