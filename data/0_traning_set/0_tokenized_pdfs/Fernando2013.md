### a b s t r a c t

Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Yitpi and cv. Janz) was grown under field conditions in the Australian Grains Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (AGFACE) facility. Ambient [CO2] (a[CO2], ∼384 mol mol−1) and elevated [CO2] (e[CO2], ∼550 mol mol−1) were combined with two soil water levels (rain-fed and irrigated) and two times of sowing (TOS)in three consecutive years to provide six environments (2007-TOS1, 2007-TOS2, 2008-TOS1, 2008-TOS2, 2009-TOS1, 2009-TOS2). Grain samples were assessed for a range of physical, nutritional and dough rheological properties. The effect of e[CO2] on thousand grain weight (TGW) was significantly different in each growing environment: TGW was significantly increased under e[CO2] only at 2007-TOS2 (by 5%), 2009-TOS1 (by 5%) and 2009-TOS2 (by 15%) but not significantly changed under other conditions. The magnitude of reduction of grain protein concentration at e[CO2] differed among the growing environments but was highly correlated with the percentage yield stimulation under e[CO2] (r2 = 0.91) suggesting that grain protein concentration under e[CO2] was diluted by increased yield. Across all treatments, grain nutrient concentration was significantly reduced by e[CO2] for Fe (3.9%, 6.2%), Cu (2.2%, 3.4%), Zn (5.9%, 5.7%), Ca (5.6%, 7.3%), Mg (5.6%, 5.8%), Na (21.2%, 30.4%), S (4.4%, 4.4%), P (4.1%, 3.2%) in cv. Yitpi and Janz, respectively. Effects of e[CO2] on grain Zn, Mg and Na concentrations were dependent on the growing environment. Relative reduction of grain S, Fe, Mg, Zn, P at e[CO2] were significantly correlated with grain yield stimulation at e[CO2]. Reductions of these nutrients under e[CO2] were not fully explained by biomass dilution as the relationships differed for each nutrient. Under e[CO2], flour yield of cv. Janz was increased but that of cv. Yitpi was not changed. Even though grain protein concentrations of both cultivars were similar at e[CO2], bread volume as inferred indirectly by dough rheology parameters was 12% greater for cv. Janz (185 ± 5 cm3) than cv. Yitpi (162 ± 4 cm3) at e[CO2]. This disparity may be related to the compositional changes in wheat flour protein at e[CO2], suggesting that future breeding and adaptation strategies to improve the grain quality under e[CO2] should consider the prevailing hydro-thermal conditions.

# **2. Materials and method**

# 2.1. Experiment and CO2 exposure

The experiment was conducted under field conditions in the AGFACE facility at Horsham, Victoria, Australia (36◦45 07S, 142◦06 52E; 128 m above sea level) during the 2007, 2008 and 2009 growing seasons. The climate in the region is Mediterranean with an average annual rainfall at the experimental site of 427 mm (1981–2010), where around 250–300 mm rainfall is received in the winter crop growing season, between May and November [(Australian](#page-8-0) [Bureau](#page-8-0) [of](#page-8-0) [Meteorology,](#page-8-0) [2012).](#page-8-0) The soil type of the experimental site is Vertosol according to the Australian Soil Classification ([Isbell,](#page-9-0) [1996).](#page-9-0) Soil consists of ∼35% clay atthe soil surface, increasing up to 60% at 1.4 m depth.

Sixteen plots were arranged into four blocks with four replications in each year; 8 plots ("rings") with e[CO2] (∼550 ppm) and 8 a[CO2] plots (∼384 ppm). CO2 was injected during daylight hours from crop emergence to maturity. The experimental design for all three growing seasons was a complete randomized split-split block design with two [CO2] treatments (a[CO2] and e[CO2]) as the main plot (fixed factor). In 2007, plots were split for TOS, while in 2008 and 2009 they were split for water supply (rain-fed and irrigated). The two cultivars of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Yitpi and cv. Janz) were randomized withineachhalfplot(TOS in2007 and water supply in 2008 and 2009). In 2007 and 2008 ring diameters were 12 m, and in 2009 16 m. TOS1 was a 'normal' sowing date according to local agricultural practice and the TOS2 treatment was a late sowing date designed to push the flowering period later into a warmer time of year. In 2007, sowing and harvest dates, respectively, were: TOS1, 18 June and 12 December; TOS2, 23 August and 2 January 2008. In 2008, sowing and harvest dates, respectively, were: TOS1, 4 June and 8 December; TOS2, 5 August and 15 December 2008. In 2009 sowing and harvest dates, respectively, were: TOS1, 23 June and 4 December; TOS2, 19 August and 15 December 2009. Plots were hydrologically split to provide the two levels of irrigation using a buried polythene barrier to 0.8 m depth to avoid the water seepage in both 2008 and 2009 growing seasons. Agronomic practices in this experiment were similar to normal farming practices of the region.

#### 2.2. Climatic and growth conditions

Growth conditions of normal sowing time and late sowing time of 2007, 2008 and 2009 growing seasons are illustrated in [Fig.](#page-2-0) 1(a–c). Plants were sown at TOS1 experienced cooler, wetter growing conditions during pre-anthesis (from sowing to 50% anthesis, DC65) than those sown at TOS2 in each year ([Fig.](#page-2-0) 1a–c). Average maximum air temperatures seven days before anthesis were for TOS1 (23 ◦C in 2007 and 22 ◦C in 2009) compared with 33 ◦C in 2007 and 35 ◦C in 2009 for the TOS2 treatment. During the 2008 growing season, average maximum air temperature seven days before anthesis was 18 ◦C in TOS1 and 24 ◦C in TOS2, showing only a 6 ◦C difference and lower temperatures than the other two years. The 2009-TOS2 grown plants experienced two consecutive days of 40 ◦C immediately after anthesis. Accumulated growing degree days (GDD) were calculated by summing daily degree days according to [(Darroch](#page-9-0) [and](#page-9-0) [Baker,](#page-9-0) [1990).](#page-9-0) Daily degrees days were calculated as Tn = (Tmax + Tmin)/2 − Tb, where Tmax and Tmin are the maximum and minimum daily temperatures, respectively, and Tb is the base temperature (5 ◦C). Post-anthesis average GDD (from 50% anthesis, DC65 to grain maturity) differed between seasons: 2007- TOS1 (4.6 ◦C), 2007-TOS2 (6.4 ◦C) 2008-TOS1 (6.1 ◦C), 2008-TOS2 (7.4 ◦C), 2009-TOS1 (7.8 ◦C), and in 2009-TOS2 (9.8 ◦C).

#### 2.3. Plant material

To bread wheat cultivars (T. aestivum L.) cv. Yitpi and cv. Janz, widely grown in South-eastern Australia were sown. Yitpi is a moderate to high yielding cultivar with high tillering capacity and categorised as Australian hard (AH) quality wheat. Cultivar Yitpi has the pedigree Champlein/II 8156//Mengavi/Siete Cerros T 66/4/Champlein/II 8156//Heron/3/Mengavi/Siete Cerros T 66/5/Dagger/Molineux//2*RAC111/Insignia and was developed by Waite Institute, University of Adelaide, Australia. Cultivar Janz is reported as a high yielding cultivar under drier conditions, classified as Australian hard (AH) wheat and has good milling and dough mixing properties. Cultivar Janz has the pedigree 3 Ag3/4* Condor//Cook and was developed by Queensland Department of Primary Industries in 1989 [(Brennan](#page-8-0) et [al.,](#page-8-0) [1991).](#page-8-0) Overall flour and dough quality of cv. Yitpi is very similar to Janz.

## 2.4. Grain sample preparation, analysis of grain physical properties and protein

Wheat spikes harvested at maturity were dried at room temperature and grains were separated and aspirated (Vacuum separator, Kimseed, Australia) to remove the remaining husk and dust, and stored at 20 ◦C in plastic containers to avoid moisture absorption until further analysis. Grain size classes (>2.00 mm, 2 mm–1.8 mm, 1.8 mm–1.5 mm, <1.5 mm) were analysed using a Sortimat (Type K3, Pfeuffer, Germany). Thousand-grain weight (TGW) was measured. Test weight (kg hl−1) was determined using chrondrometer according to approved method 55–10 ([AACC](#page-8-0) [International,](#page-8-0) [2000).](#page-8-0) The grain hardness index and single grain diameter were measured

using the Single Kernel Characterization System (SKCS) (Perten Instruments North America, Springfield, IL, USA). Total protein content in whole-grain was determined by Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIR, Foss, Sweden) according to approved method 39–25 [(AACC](#page-8-0) [International,](#page-8-0) [2000)](#page-8-0) and was expressed on a grain dry weight basis.

### 2.5. Grain mineral analysis

Grain samples were analysed for mineral nutrient concentrations by inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP–AES) (Applied Research Laboratories, 3580B, Switzerland) afterdigestioninconcentratednitric acid(HNO3)following theprocedure of [(Zarcinas](#page-9-0) et [al.,](#page-9-0) [1987).](#page-9-0) Briefly,this entailed cold-digestion of 0.8 g of ground wheat kernels with ultrapure concentrated HNO3 (9 ml) overnightinthe tubes beforeheating.Hydrochloric acid(HCl) was added during two stages of digestion (0.4 ml initially + 0.2 ml at completion) under a controlled regime in an open vessel (75 ml borosilicate glass tube) and the final volume was made up to 25 ml. Digestion was conducted for 5–6 h with the maximum temperature not exceeding 140 ◦C. Mineral concentration (g kg−1 or mg kg−1) was expressed on a grain dry weight basis.

### 2.6. Grain milling and flour mixing properties

Grain samples (30 g) were tempered for 24 h at 13.5% moisture and milled on a Quadrumat Junior Mill (Brabender, OHG Duisburg, Germany). Flour was separated from the bran through a 0.2 mm size sieve and flour yield was calculated [flour (g)/total grain (g) × 100]. Mixograph analysis was conducted using 10 g flour samples to obtain mixing properties (Reologica Instruments, Sweden) as described ([Fernando](#page-9-0) et [al.,](#page-9-0) [2012b).](#page-9-0) Some of these reomixer parameters are directly related to the basic rheological aspects of the mixing properties ([Bohlin,](#page-8-0) [2007).](#page-8-0) For example, "peak time" describes the mixing requirements, "peak height" is a measure of dough strength, "breakdown" reflects dough stability, and "peak width" measures extensibility [(Bohlin,](#page-8-0) [2007).](#page-8-0)

#### 2.7. Statistical analysis

Statistical differences among dependent variables were tested using the General Linear Models of MINITAB ver. 16 (Minitab, Sydney, NSW, Australia). A four way ANOVA was conducted testing effects of CO2 (e[CO2] vs. a[CO2]), growing environment conditions (TOS and year combined: 2007-TOS1, 2007-TOS2, 2008-TOS1, 2008- TOS2, 2009-TOS1, 2009-TOS2), water supply (rain-fed vs. irrigated) and cultivar (Janz vs. Yitpi) as well as their interactions on grain quality parameters followed by comparison of means with Student's paired t-test. Homogeneity of variances was checked with the Levene's test. Statistical effects were regarded as significant at P ≤ 0.05.
