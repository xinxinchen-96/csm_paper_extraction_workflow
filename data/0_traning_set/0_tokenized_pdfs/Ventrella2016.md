## a b s t r a c t

A long-term experiment comparing different crop residue (CR) managements was established in 1977 in Foggia (Apulia region, southern Italy). The objective of this study was to investigate the long-term effects of different types of crop residue management on main yield response parameters in a continuous cropping system of winter durum wheat. In order to correctly interpret the results, models accounting for spatial error autocorrelation were used and compared with ordinary least square models.

Eight crop residue management treatments, based on burning of wheat straw and stubble or their incorporation with or without N fertilization and irrigation, were compared. The experimental design was a complete randomized block with five replicates.

Results indicated that the dynamics of yield, grain protein content and hectolitric weight of winter durum wheat did not show any decline as usually expected when a monoculture is carried out for a long time. In addition, the temporal variability of productivity was more affected by meteorological factors, such as air temperature and rainfall, than CR management treatments. Higher wheat grain yields and hectolitric weights quite frequently occurred after burning of wheat straw compared with straw incorporation without nitrogen fertilization and autumn irrigation and this was attributed to temporary mineral N immobilization in the soil. The rate of 50 kg ha−1 of N seemed to counterbalance this negative effect when good condition of soil moisture occurred in the autumn period, so yielding the same productive level of straw burning treatment.

## 2.1. Experimental layout and agronomic practices

The field experiment was established in 1977 at the experimental farm "Podere 124" of CRA-SCA located in Foggia (41◦27 latitude N, 15◦36 longitude E, 90 m above sea level) on a soil with clayloam texture of alluvial origin, classified by Soil Taxonomy-USDA as fine, mesic, Typic Chromoxerert(Soil Survey Staff, 1992). The soil has a good availability of total nitrogen (0.12 g 100 g−1) and organic matter (2.07 g 100 g−1) and a content of 41 of available phospho-

rus (P2O5). In summer it very frequently shows 4–5 cm wide cracks from the surface to 50-cm depth.

The climate is classified as "accentuated thermomediterranean" (Unesco-FAO classification), with temperatures that may fall below 0 ◦C in winter and exceed 40 ◦C in summer. Rainfall is unevenly distributed throughout the year and is mostly concentrated in the winter months with a long-term annual average of 550 mm.

The experimental farm is located in Apulian Tavoliere, a very important area, from agricultural and economic point of view, mostly cropped with winter durum wheat (T. durum, Desf.).

The experimental design is a randomized block with five replicates, unit plots of 80-m2 size and eight crop residue (CR) management treatments as follows: T1, burning of crop residues; T2, incorporation of stubble and straw (CR) into the soil; T3, CR incorporation + 50 kg ha−1 of N (as urea) spread on CR before the incorporation; T4, CR incorporation + 100 kg ha−1 of N spread on CR; T5, CR incorporation + 150 kg ha−1 of N spread on CR; T6, as T3 treatment + 500 m3 ha−1 of water on CR; T7, as T4 treatment + 500 m3 ha−1 of water on CR; T8, as T5 treatment + 500 m3 ha−1 of water on CR. The minimum doses of nitrogen added to the residues (as urea) were determined taking into account that soil micro-organisms (fundamental to decomposition of CR) require a quantity of N between 0.8 and 1.4 kg per 100 kg of dry matter incorporated; the amount of water used was established considering a rainfall of 50 mm. In alltreatments, 100 kg ha−1 of P2O5 was applied before the main tillage as well as 100 kg ha−1 of N as top dressing (NH4NO3).

After wheat harvesting,typically occurring in the middle ofJune, straw and stubble are chopped to 10–15 cm lengths and spread back on the plots of the treatments from T2 to T8. The urea is then applied and next incorporated with the chopped straw and stubble into the soil through the primary ploughing of 40 cm. In accordance with local practices, the secondary tillage consists of tooth-harrow or disc-harrow for seedbed preparation in order to improve wheat germination. The sowing is usually carried out in October or November but it may be delayed to December due to adverse meteorological conditions. Durum wheat is sown in all

plots on the same day with a conventional sowing machine at rows 15 cm apart and 3–4 cm deep. During the research period, 1977–2012, different cultivars were sown with cycles of 5 years: Valgerardo (sown between 1977 and 1981), Appulo (1982–1986), Latino (1987–1991), Appio (1992–1995), Simeto (1996–1999 and 2006–2012), Ofanto (2000–2005). Due to the particularly dry conditions, supplemental irrigations were done in eight years during the entire experiment with irrigation depths ranging from 30 to 70 mm and mostly from January to April.

Weeds are controlled chemically with herbicides applied in March before stem elongation and in accordance to the local practices.

At winter wheat harvesting, grain production ismeasured on the whole area of each plot. Grain samples are randomly collected at ten points of each plot for determining grain dry weight (obtained by drying composite samples until constant weight), and total N content (Fisons CHN elemental analyser, model EA 1108). After drying, seeds of each sample are separated and weighed for calculating 1000-kernel weight (g). Hectolitric weight (weight per unit volume) was measured on three samples of 250 g per plot and expressed as kg hl−1, using a "FOSS INFRATEC 1241" grain analyser equipped with test weight module.

## 2.2. Statistical analysis

## 2.2.1. Preliminary statistical analysis for wheat yield response parameters

Descriptive statistics were calculated to synthesize main features of data distribution for the grain yield and quality parameters under study: grain protein content (GPC), hectolitric weight (HTW) and thousand seed weight (TSW). In addition the variables were tested for heteroscedasticity by cultivar and treatment classes with Levene's test.

## 2.2.2. Linear mixed effect model

The standard linear model (OLS) can be written as:

$$Y_{\bar{l}} = \sum_{j}^{p} \mathbf{x}_{\bar{l}\bar{l}} \boldsymbol{\beta}_{\bar{l}} + \mathbf{e}_{\bar{l}} \qquad \bar{i} = 1, \ldots N$$

where yi are N data points of the response variable (i.e., wheat yield) atlocation i, xij are the observations ofthe p explanatory variables (j), which can be continuous or dummy variables, declaring class membership of a categorical variable (i.e.,treatment, cultivar), (ˇi) . . . (ˇp) are fixed effect coefficients to be estimated, and ei are unknown independent and identically distributed normal random variables with mean 0 and variance -2.

The previous equation can be written using matrix notation as:

$$\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \mathbf{e}$$

where **Y** is the vector ofthe responses, **X** the matrix ofthe observations, **ˇ** the vector of the unknown fixed effect coefficients and **e** the vector of independent and identically distributed normal random errors, or in symbol, e ∼ N(0, -2**I**) where **I** is identity matrix [(Rodrigues](#page-9-0) et [al.,](#page-9-0) [2013).](#page-9-0) If the error variance -2 is not constant but varies with the classes of a categorical variable (i.e. year, cultivar), the model is heteroscedastic.

However, independence assumption about **Y** is often too restrictive and linear mixed effect model extends the general linear model by allowing elements of **Y** to be correlated on both space and time. This can be performed in the following way:

(i) through specification of a spatial covariance function of **e** as a function of the distance between two locations i and j (dij), say: e ∼ N(0, **R**), for spatial variability;

(ii) and the addition of a random effect in the model (**Zu**), where **u** ∼ N(0, **G**). **Z** is a matrix, similar to **X**, that captures the complex covariance structure of the temporal factor. Differently from **ˇ**, the vector **u** does not contain parameters but random variables.

The general linear mixed effect model can thus be written as:

Y = Xˇ + Zu + e

with Cov [**u**, **e**] = 0, which implies the assumption that **u** and **e** are uncorrelated.

In the spatial model, **R**= -2p**F** + -2 l**I**, where **F** is an N × N matrix whose ijth element is f(dij); thus, the error variance of the OLS model (-2**I**) is split into a spatially structured (-2p**F**) variance and a spatially independent (residual) variance (-2 l**I**).

The spatial covariance model has the form:

Var[ei] = -2 p + -2 l

Cov[ei,ej] = -2 p[f(dij)],

where f(dij) is the selected geostatistical spatial covariance function of the distance dij between pairs of observations (i, j), using a parameter for spatial scale (range); -2 l and -2p correspond to the geostatistical parameters of nugget effect and partial sill, respectively. The spatial covariance was modeled using a spherical function of the distance.

A further complexity was added in the spatial model by allowing variance to vary as a function of cultivar, because it can cause heterogeneity in the spatial covariance function. Specifically, two groups were defined that included most productive (Simeto, Ofanto; class A) and less productive (Appio, Appulo, Latino, Valgerardo; class B) cultivars; different spatial models were thus fitted per cultivar class.

The fitting process relies on an iterative procedure aimed at maximizing the log likelihood of the residuals using restricted maximum likelihood method (REML; [Littell](#page-9-0) et [al.,](#page-9-0) [2006).](#page-9-0) The fixed effects estimates are obtained as generalized least squares estimates evaluated at the REML estimates of the covariance parameters.

The temporal relationship was explored by postulating homoscedastic autoregressive structure of order 1 (AR(1)) for the matrix**G**, with correlations that decline exponentially with the time series ([Rodrigues](#page-9-0) et [al.,](#page-9-0) [2013).](#page-9-0) The AR(1) covariance structure has two unknown parameters:the variance (-2t) and the lag-one correlation (t). The year, as temporal factor, was included in the model also as a fixed effect, as a dummy variable in the matrix**X**, in order to assess systematic or trend componentin crop parameters variation.

The fixed effects of the model were then: treatment, year, the interaction between year and treatment, and cultivar.

Non-spatial models (OLS), including the same fixed effects ofthe spatial models but with F = 0, were also computed.

In this study, to test the impact of the types of CR management on wheat yield, different regression models were estimated and compared: ordinary least squares (OLS) models and linear mixed effects (LME) models with residual autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity ([Schabenberger](#page-9-0) [and](#page-9-0) [Gotway,](#page-9-0) [2005).](#page-9-0)

## 2.2.3. Comparison of spatial and non-spatial models

Spatial and non-spatial models were compared using likelihood ratio statistic ([Castrignanò](#page-9-0) et [al.,](#page-9-0) [2005).](#page-9-0) The test compares two covariance models, one as a special case of the other. Specifically, it tests whether the simplifications used in the non-spatial model are still applicable in the experimental conditions [(Wolfinger,](#page-10-0) [1993).](#page-10-0) Under the null hypothesis that the spatial model is not different from the non-spatial model, the likelihood ratio statistics is distributed as -2 with the number of degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters between the two models. Because the fixed part is the same in the spatial and non-spatial models compared, only the parameters in the variance–covariance structure need to be considered, and thus the test is computed under the null hypothesis H0: = 0 and -2 p = 0, when (F) reduces to (I), with two degrees of freedom.

When the testis not significant,the most parsimonious model is selected and evaluated through residual analysis (mean and standard deviation of standardized error which should be close to 0 and 1, respectively).

All statistical analyses were computed using SAS/STAT (release 9.3, SAS INSTITUTE) and the models were estimated using PROC MIXED. Least Square (LS) means and contrast statements were used to evaluate the differences among the treatments. [Table](#page-2-0) 1 shows the coefficients of the seven orthogonal contrasts (C1–C7).
