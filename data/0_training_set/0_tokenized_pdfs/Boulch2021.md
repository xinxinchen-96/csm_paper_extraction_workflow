#### **ABSTRACT**

Soybean is a candidate crop to increase the independency of Europe in leguminous protein crops. However, its adaptation to northern European regions is not yet well defined due to the lack of long-term references. Herein, we simulated soybean yield potential in northern France and identified the main yield limiting factors under rainfed vs. irrigated conditions. Two cultivars representing maturity groups 000 and 00 were planted within three different trials. Leaf area index, shoot and pod biomass, main phenological stages and yield were recorded to evaluate CROPGRO-soybean model predictability. Adjustment of genetic coefficients was performed prior to simulate yield on 21-years weather database (1999–2018) at Beauvais (France, N 49.46°, E 2.07°) and Estrées-Mons (France, N 49.88°, E 3.01°) under different water regimes and planting dates. Predictions showed that adding irrigation at grain filling period would increase yield potential to the level of non-water limited scenarios. Although simulated yield variability is reduced with irrigation, the remaining variability suggests that water is not the only yield-limiting factor. A tentative explanation is proposed by deriving environmental covariates from the model. The analysis confirmed the importance of precipitation amount (optimum around 200 mm) and duration (optimum around 60 days) of the flowering to physiological maturity period under rainfed conditions. Under irrigated conditions, increasing evapotranspiration and average minimum temperature affected simulated yield positively while increasing the number of days below 10 °C had a negative impact. These results give insights for soybean crop management and bring indications to breeders for adapting the existing genetic material to northern Europe.

# **2 . MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Validation of model predictability with experimental data**

**2.1.1** *Experimental design.* Two soybean (*Glycine max* L.) cultivars: RGT Sirelia (MG 000) and ES Mentor (MG 00) were planted within three rainfed trials in 2019, at the experimental farms of the Institut Polytechnique UniLaSalle (Beauvais, France) and ANTEDIS com pany (Catillon-Fumechon, France). Daily weather data were recorded for the two locations: minimum and maximum temperatures, pre cipitations and solar radiation. Soil was characterized at each experi mental site by analysing 15 cm layer samples along the soil profile (0–90 cm, 3 replicates) [(Table 1](#page-1-0)). Two planting dates were managed at Beauvais (April 24 and May 17) and one at Catillon-Fumechon (April 23). Planting was carried out with a single seed air planter and a density of 70 plants m−2 (0.45 m row spacing). Experimental plots (10 m × 2.7 m) were replicated five times and assigned to a randomized complete block design. Before planting, seeds were inoculated with *Bradyrhizobium japonicum* (G49 strain).

<span id="page-1-0"></span>Table 1.Location and soil description at experimental sites. **2.1.2** *Growth and phenology measurements.* Plants were sampled (0.45 m2 ) at 15- to 20-day intervals throughout the crop life cycle, starting at emergence +20 days. Plants were separated into leaves, stems (petioles included) and pods. Cumulative fresh leaf area was measured in each sample using LI-3100C Area Meter instrument (LI-COR®) and used to determine the Leaf Area Index (LAI). Plant leaves, stems and pods were dried at 65 °C for 72h and weighed. Crop development was observed twice a week to identify growth stages VE, V2, R1, R3 and R7 according to Fehr and Caviness [(Fehr and Caviness](#page-11-13) [1977](#page-11-13)) staging method. At harvest maturity, seed dry yield, shoot dry biomass and Harvest Index (HI) were measured for each plot after 24 h at 105 °C [(Battisti 2016](#page-10-6)).

**2.1.3** *Crop model simulations.* CROPGRO-soybean model − DSSAT v4.7.5 (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) [(Boote](#page-10-4) *et al.* 1998, [2003](#page-10-7); [Jones](#page-11-14) *et al.* 2003; [Hoogenboom](#page-11-15) *et al.* 2019) was chosen for simulations. The Willmott agreement index (*d*-stat) [(Willmott](#page-12-1) *et al.* 2012) and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to evaluate simulations accuracy [(Willmott 1982](#page-12-2)). A model calibration was performed using the in-season growth and development field measurements. Cultivar coefficients of the two generic cultivars MG 000 and MG 00 available in the model were manually adjusted. The calibration procedure started with phenology first and then growth parameters [(Hunt and Boote 1998](#page-11-16)). The coefficients were kept within the typical range values for soybean [(Boote](#page-10-7) *et al.* 2003) and validated on the basis of maximizing the *d*-stat values and minimizing the RMSE for each time-series growth trait.

# **2.2 Evaluation of agronomic suitability and yield potential of soybean**

To evaluate yield potential and agronomic suitability, two sites representing contrasted environments of Northern France were selected. One was Beauvais (same site used for calibration) and the other one was Estrées-Mons, France (Lat. 49.878, Long. -3.0067). It is expected that our study sites have a prediction power for regions beyond our scope. A weather database including daily minimum and maximum temperature, solar radiation (MJ/m2 ), precipitation (mm) and potential evapotranspiration (mm) was assembled from 1999 to 2019 for both sites. Two soils representing each location (deep silt) were selected for simulations. Two agronomic factors were evaluated to assess yield potential of the calibrated cultivars RGT Sirelia (MG 000) and ES Mentor (MG 00): the planting date and water regime. CROPGRO-soybean model has demonstrated its value in evaluating yield response to planting date and irrigation scenarios [(Salmerόn](#page-12-3) *et al.* [2017;](#page-12-3) Yassi *et al.* [2019)](#page-12-4). A series of planting dates were tested in a first time (April 20, April 30, May 10, May 20 and May 30) to select the optimal and latest possible ones: April 30 and May 20, respectively. The optimal date maximized the average simulated grain yield and minimized its variability across the 21 years of simulations. The latest possible date ensured a harvest maturity date compatible with a secure winter wheat planting. These two dates will be the two planting scenarios used in our study. Two water regimes were tested: rainfed and irrigated. The irrigated regime, compatible with regional agronomic practices, was determined by minimizing the simulated yield difference with the non-water limited simulation option of the model: 3 irrigation amounts of 30 mm at 60, 80 and 100 days after planting. All simulations were performed considering a planting density of 70 seeds per square metre and a row spacing of 0.45 m.

#### **2.3 Identification of environmental covariates**

**2.3.1** *Environmental variables calculation.* Based on the individual year simulations, 35 environmental covariates were calculated to identify key factors explaining year to year yield variation. The variables were defined around three development stages that are simulated in DSSAT seasonal analysis: sowing to emergence (SEM), emergence to flowering (EMFL), flowering to physiological maturity (FLPM). Four major categories of variables were identified: duration of stages (in number of days), temperature variables (average minimum temperatures, number of days below 10 °C, number of days below 15 °C, average maximum temperatures, number of days above 30 °C, number of days above 34 °C), water variables (cumulative rainfall and irrigation in mm, potential evapotranspiration in mm), solar radiation (cumulative daily solar radiation, average of solar radiation in MJ/m2 ), photothermal quotient (defined as the ratio of solar radiation on heat units).

**2.3.2** *Statistical analysis.* After generating the environmental variables, two tables were created. The X-table contained the year/location combinations with all the calculated environmental covariates and the Y-table represented the simulated yield values, estimated by the model for each year/location combination. Statistical models are available to sort out the most relevant variables explaining yield variation. Among them, bilinear models such as Partial Least Square Regression (PLS) models seemed particularly appropriate [(Crossa](#page-11-17) *et al.* 2010). One of the advantages of PLS over linear factor regression models is the possibility to evaluate a high number of covariables allowing to integrate as many as possible environmental variables and so, limiting a priori statements on the factors to include or not in the analysis. There are adapted versions of PLS to address different objectives (regression, classification, variable selection, and survival analysis) [(Mehmood and](#page-11-18)  [Ahmed 2016)](#page-11-18). We used the variable selection methods accepting that X-matrix contains redundant or irrelevant variables without impacting the results [(Mehmood](#page-11-19) *et al.* 2012). Among these variable selection methods, we used the filter method taking VIP (Variable Important in the Projection) as a selection criterion. Variables with a VIP>1 are the ones that are considered as able to explain the Y-table. The number of components were defined based on the Wold algorithm ([Wold et al.](#page-12-5)  [1984,](#page-12-5) [1987,](#page-12-6) [2001;](#page-12-7) [Tenenhaus](#page-12-8) *et al.* 2005). Analysis were performed under R software.
