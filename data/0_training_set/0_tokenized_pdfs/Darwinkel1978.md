# **Summary**

The effect of plant density on the growth and productivity of the various ear-bearing shoots of winter wheat was studied in detail to obtain information on the pattern of grain production of crops grown under field conditions.

Strong compensation effects were measured: a 160-fold increase in plant density (5 to 800 plants/m2 ) finally resulted in a 3-fold increase in grain yield (282 to 850 g DM/m2 ). Maximum grain yield was achieved at 100 plants per m2 , which corresponded to 430 ears/m2 and to about 19 000 grains per m2 . At higher plant densities more ears and more grains were produced, but grain yield remained constant. Tillering per plant was largely favoured by low plant densities, because these allowed tiller formation to continue for a longer period and a greater proportion of tillers produced ears. Per unit area, however, at higher plant densities more tillers were formed and, despite a higher mortality, more ears were produced.

The productivity of individual ears, from main shoots as well as from tillers, decreased with increasing plant density and with later emergence of shoots. In the range from 5 to 800 plants/m2 grain yield per ear decreased from 2.40 to 1.14 g DM. At 800 plants/m2 nearly alle ears originated from main shoots, but with decreasing plant density tillers contributed increasingly to the number of ears. At 5 plants/m2 , 23 ears were found per plant and grain yield per ear ranged from 4.20 (main shoot) to 1.86 g DM (late-formed shoots). Grain number per ear was reduced at higher densities and on younger shoots, because there were fewer fertile spikeiets and fewer grains in these spikeiets. At the low density of 5 plants/m2 , plants developed solitarily and grain yield per ear was determined by the number of grains per ear as well as by grain weight. Above 400 ears per m2 , in this experiment reached at 100 plants/m2 and more, grain yield per ear depended solely on grain number, because the weights of grains of the various shoots were similar.

The harvest index showed a maximum of about 44 % at a moderate plant densi-

ty; at this density nearly maximal grain yield was achieved. At low plant densities the harvest index decreased from 45 % in main shoots to about 36 % in late-formed shoots. However, no differences in harvest index existed between the various earbearing shoots if the number of ears exceeded 400 per m2 .

# **Materials and methods**

In a field experiment winter wheat (cv. Lely) was sown by hand in small plots well over 1 m2 on 19 October 1976 on a fertile, clayey Flevopolder soil (pH 7.4). The size of the seeds ranged from 2.75 to 3.25 mm; they were placed 20 - 30 mm deep on a square grid. Open places were filled up later. The following seven plant densities were obtained: 5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 plants/m2 . The scheme was a completely randomized design with four replicates. At harvest, 0.2 m2 of each plot was taken for analysis. To enable a clear comparison to be made between the widely different plant densities, undesirable interactions were obviated as much as possible by preventing damage from mice and birds, controlling disease by frequent applications of fungicides, preventing lodging by using wire-netting, and by supplying adéquat nutrients to avoid mineral deficiency. These measures lowered the incoming radiation energy at crop level by about 10 %.

During winter and spring the order in which the tillers were formed was established by marking the shoots that were 20 - 40 mm long with plastic rings of different colours. The shoots were marked on 10 November (main shoots = Ms), 18 February (early tillers = Tl), 7 March (T2), 24 March (T3), 4 April (T4), 15 April (T5)

and 25 April (T6); tillers formed after 25 April (T7) were not marked. This enabled the shoots to be classified according to age and their development to be recorded easily. The first markings were made when approximately one tiller per plant had emerged at all densities. On later dates the age classes often consisted of more than one tiller, especially at low plant densities. At harvest, the weight of grains, straw and chaff, the number of ears, fertile and empty spikeiets and grains per ear were determined. For the determination of dry matter yields, plant material was dried at 105 °C for at least 16 hours.

The spikeiets were counted at maturation. Fertile spikeiets could easily be identified, but empty, apical spikeiets decreased sharply in size, which impeded counting. Thus the total number of spikeiets counted might not be exactly the number of spikeiets initiated.

Temperature, water supply and light intensity are important factors in crop growth. Weather conditions during the growth of winter wheat in this experiment are presented in Fig. 1.
