Keywords: AquaCrop model Winter wheat Deficit irrigation North China Plain

## a b s t r a c t

Winter wheat is the main crop on the North China Plain (NCP), and in this region the most limiting factor for the crop is water. The objective of this study was to adapt and test the ability of the FAO-developed AquaCrop model (v3.1) to simulate winter wheat grain yield, biomass, actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and total soil water content (0–120 cm). Field experiments were conducted under deficit irrigation at the Luancheng Agro-ecosystem station (NCP) in 1998–2001, and the AquaCrop model was calibrated with treatment D (1999–2000); the rest of the data was used for validation of the model. The AquaCrop model was revalidated with data on measured grain yield from the experimental station for 1990–2010, considering actual field conditions. The second revalidation was done with the statistical grain yield for 1995–2010 in the study region. For the model validation, the significant differences between simulated and observed grain yield, biomass and ETa were in the order of: rainfed treatment > well-watered treatment > moderate water stress. Total soil water simulated by AquaCrop tends to follow closely the trend in the measured data, but with slight underestimations for irrigated treatments and significant overestimations for rainfed treatments. In general, errors in the model's evaluation such as RMSE and Willmot's d statistics were for grain yield (0.58 Mg ha−1, 0.92), biomass (0.87 Mg ha−1, 0.95), ETa (33.2 mm, 0.93) and soil water content (24.5–37.6 mm, 0.85–0.90). The overall results based on extensive validation and revalidation showed that AquaCrop is a valid model and can be used with a reliable degree of accuracy for optimizing winter wheat grain yield production and water requirement on the NCP.

# **2. Methodology**

Experiments were conducted at the Luancheng agro-ecosystem station (37◦53 N, 114◦41 E, 50.1 m a.s.l.), one of 34 agricultural ecosystemstations intheChinese EcologicalResearchNetwork. The station is located in Luancheng county on the NCP ([Fig.](#page-2-0) 1), and has a fertile topsoil, plenty of organic matter in loamy soil, and a high grain yield [(Zhang](#page-11-0) et [al.,](#page-11-0) [2002).](#page-11-0) It has a temperate semiarid monsoon climate, with a mean annual temperature of 12.2 ◦C, mean annual global radiation of 524 kJ/cm2, and mean annual precipitation of 481 mm, most of which occurs from late June to September. Winter wheatis themaincrop inthis region. The growing seasonfor winter wheat is from early October to mid-June ([Table](#page-2-0) 1). The rainfall does not meet the needs of wheat for normal growth, especially during the dry, windy spring season. [Table](#page-2-0) 2 shows the distribution of precipitation in the years ofthe experiment. [Fig.](#page-3-0) 2 gives the overall climate conditions for the wheat season from 1985 to 2010. Local soil characteristics and parameters are shown in [Table](#page-2-0) 3, indicating fertile topsoil and abundant organic matter in the loamy soil.

Experiments on winter wheat were conducted in three consecutive seasons from 1998 to 2001. Fifteen 5 m × 10 m plots were created and divided by concrete walls for five irrigation schedules. The walls are 24.5 cm thick and extend 1.5 m beneath the surface, in accordance with the specifications set by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Winter wheat, Gaoyou No. 503, was sown by hand at a rate of 150 kg ha−1, 20 cm wide per row. Before sowing, each plot was irrigated with about 80 mm water

containing 300 kg ha−1 ammonium phosphate and 150 kg ha−1 urea. Five kinds of deficitirrigationschedules were tested for winter wheat based on growth stages, and each treatment was replicated three times [(Table](#page-2-0) 4). Irrigation amounts in the experimental treatments were in the order of >D > B >A> C > E. In our experiment, treatment E is not irrigated after spring, and is thus regarded as a rainfed treatment; all treatments were irrigated before winter dormancy to ensure the winter wheat could survive the cold winter. Irrigation amounts and timing during the experiments are shown in Table 5. The area of the grain yield (GY) measurement was a 3 m × 8 m portion in the heart of each plot, and a 1000-kernel weight was determined from the harvested grains. For dry matter, 10 plants were measured after drying for 48 h in an oven at 65 ◦C. Soil water content was measured using a neutron probe (Institute of Hydrology, UK) down to 160 cm depth at 20 cm intervals, approximately every 5 days. Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) was calculated by the water balance method. Details of the field layout and experimental structure are given in [Zhang](#page-11-0) et [al.](#page-11-0) [(2004),](#page-11-0) but a brief description is presented here to contribute to the understanding of this paper.

#### 2.1. Input data and calibration of the AquaCrop model

AquaCrop version 3.1 Plus was used in this study and run under GDD (Growing Degree Days) for a more realistic consideration of the behavior of winter crops below base temperature or under cold stress during the winter wheat dormancy period, and to ensure a more realistic simulation [(Steduto](#page-10-0) et [al.,](#page-10-0) [2009).](#page-10-0)

AquaCropuses six inputfiles for simulation: climatefile, cropfile (time to emergence, maximum canopy cover, start of senescence, maturity), soil file, management file, irrigation file, and initial soil water conditions; allthese are user specific. The climatefile consists of three sub-files: (i) minimum and maximum air temperature, (ii) ETo, and (iii) rainfall, all with daily values as described by [Raes](#page-10-0) et [al.](#page-10-0) [(2009).](#page-10-0) The crop file contains both conservative parameters (that do not change with location) and user-specific parameters (nonconservative). [Greets](#page-10-0) et [al.(2009)](#page-10-0) pointed outthatminor changes in initial SWC (e.g., from 8.5 to 10.5 vol%) resulted in major changes in the model output (400 kg ha−1 additional biomass and 250 kg ha−1 additional yield). The parameters used for the AquaCrop model

were measured or estimated using experimental data; some were based on field experience, and some used the default values given in the model, regardless of the year [(Table](#page-4-0) 6).

The AquaCrop model was calibrated using the values observed from the field experiment during 1999–2000, with deficitirrigation treatment D, for grain yield, biomass, ETa and soil water content (0–120 cm). Measured soil water content was only available for this year, and was the reason this year was selected.

Treatment D was used for the model calibration, and the model's default values were used for stress treatments. The difference between the simulated model and the experimental data was minimized by using a trial and error approach.

#### 2.2. Validation of the AquaCrop model

Validation is an important step in model verification ([Addiscot](#page-9-0) et [al.,](#page-9-0) [1995;](#page-9-0) [Power,](#page-9-0) [1993),](#page-9-0) and is done by comparing independent field measurements (data) with the outputs created by the model. Grain yield, biomass, ETa and soil water content were considered as the evaluation parameters for the AquaCrop model.

The crop parameters obtained from the model calibration were used in the validation. The independent data set was used to test the model's performance from 1998 to 2001, with 14 treatments, excluding the data used for calibration.

#### 2.3. Model evaluation

Since no single measure can indicate how well a simulation model performs, a combination of statistical indices are generally used to evaluate the model [(Caton](#page-9-0) et [al.,](#page-9-0) [1999;](#page-9-0) [Kobayashi](#page-9-0) [and](#page-9-0) [Salam,](#page-9-0) [2000;](#page-9-0) [Gauch](#page-9-0) et [al.,](#page-9-0) [2003).](#page-9-0)

The agreementbetweenthemeasuredandsimulatedvalues was assessed using the following six statistics: RMSE (root mean square error), NRMSE (normalized root mean square error), MBE (mean bias error), MAE (mean absolute error), IoA (index of agreement ([Willmott,](#page-10-0) [1982).](#page-10-0) Percentage difference was determined using the following equation, where Si; indicates simulated values and Mi; indicates measured values in all statistical indices.

$$\text{INRMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum \left(\mathbf{S}_{i} - \mathbf{M}_{i}\right)^{2}}{n}} \times \frac{\mathbf{100}}{M} \tag{1}$$

$$\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum \left( \mathbb{S}_{l} - \mathcal{M}_{l} \right)^{2}} \tag{2}$$

$$\text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum \left| \mathbf{S}_{l} - \mathbf{M}_{l} \right| \tag{3}$$

$$\text{MBE} = \frac{1}{n} \left[ \sum \text{(S}_{l} - \text{M}_{l}) \right] \tag{4}$$

$$d = 1 - \left[\frac{\sum \left(\mathbf{S}_{i} - \mathbf{M}_{i}\right)^{2}}{\sum \left(\left|\mathbf{S}_{i} - \overline{\mathbf{M}}\right| + \left|\mathbf{M}_{i} - \overline{\mathbf{M}}\right|\right)^{2}}\right] \tag{5}$$

$$\text{Percent deviation} = \text{(simulated - measured)} \times \frac{100}{\text{measured}} \qquad \text{(6)}$$

The simulation is considered excellent with a normalized RMSE of less than 10%, good if the normalized RMSE is greater than 10 and less than 20%, fair if the normalized RMSE is greater than 20% and less than 30%, and poor if the normalized RMSE is greater than 30% [(Jamieson](#page-10-0) et [al.,](#page-10-0) [1991).](#page-10-0)

IoA: A value of 1.0 indicates excellent agreement between measured and simulated values.

RMSE: Close to zero indicates better model performance.

MBE: This reveals the long-term performance of the model. A positive value of MBE gives the average amount of overestimation in the estimated values and vice versa.

MAE: This measures the weighted average magnitude of the absolute errors. All these statistics were computed using the IRENE statistical software [(Fila](#page-10-0) et [al.,](#page-10-0) [2003).](#page-10-0)
