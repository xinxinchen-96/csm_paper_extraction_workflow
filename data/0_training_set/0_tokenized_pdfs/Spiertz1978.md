### **Summary**

The crop performance of a semi-dwarf cultivar (Maris Hobbit) was compared with **a** standard-height cultivar (Lely), at various levels of nitrogen supply. The grain yields of Maris Hobbit were considerably higher due to a higher number of grains and a heavier grain weight. Owing to the higher grain yield and a lower stem weight, the harvest index of Maris Hobbit was higher than that of Lely: 0.47 and 0.40, respectively. The content of water-soluble carbohydrates in the stems of both cultivars appeared to be very high until 3 weeks after anthesis, despite the occurrence of low light intensities. Lely used more assimilates for structural stem material than did Maris Hobbit.

Quantity and time of nitrogen application greatly affected grain number, but affected grain weight to a lesser extent. Thus within each cultivar grain number per m2 was the main determinant of grain yield. Late nitrogen dressings promoted photosynthetic production, grain weight and protein content of the grains. The low protein percentages of the grains were attributed to the low temperatures during grain-filling period. The distribution of nitrogen within the wheat plant was only slightly influenced by nitrogen dressings and cultivar differences. Nitrogen harvest index ranged from 0.74 to 0.79. Grain nitrogen was derived from the vegetative organs (63-94%) and from uptake after anthesis (6-37%). The importance of carbohydrate and nitrogen economy for grain yield are discussed.

# **Materials and methods**

The experiment was carried out in 1977 on the experimental farm of the Department of Field Crops and Grassland Husbandry, Agricultural University, Wageningen. The experiment was laid down on a fine-textured clay soil. The nitrate-nitrogen content of the top 1 m of the soil layer was found to be approximately 50 kg N per ha at the end of February 1977. The preceding crop was potatoes.

The wheat was sown on 15 October 1976 at a rate of 350 kernels per m2 and a row distance of 0.25 m. The basic fertilizer dressing consisted of 500 kg N-P-K mixture (0-15-30) per ha on 15 March.

Nitrogen was applied as a split-dressing in the following treatments:

|      | March (Fa*) | May (Fg to F(J*) | Total          |
|------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| Nx   | 50          | 0                | 50 kgNha-i     |
| N2   | 0           | 50               | 50 kgNha-i     |
| Ni+2 | 50          | 50               | 100 kg N lia"1 |
|      |             |                  |                |

* According to developmental stages of the Feekes scale.

Control plots without nitrogen dressing were only present with the cultivar Lely.

The fungicide applications were sequential according to the following scheme: 11 May: 4 kg Bavistin M + 5 kg sulphur per ha

6 June: 4 kg Bavistin M + 5 kg sulphur per ha

24 June: 5 kg sulphur per ha

30 June: 0.5 kg Bayleton per ha

The complete experimental field was protected against insect damage by an application of 0.5 kg Pyrimor and 0.5 kg Dimethoaat per ha on 24 June and 6 July, respectively.

The experiment consisted of a split-split-plot design with cultivars and fungicide treatment in the splits. Nitrogen treatments were completely randomized and there were 6 replicates. The individual plots were 9 m long and 3 m wide. During the growing season the plots protected against diseases were sampled. The samples were taken from 2 rows of 0.50 m length. At the final harvest, 24 August, the complete plots, except for two border rows, were harvested.

The sampling procedure at the intermediate harvests and the chemical analyses were carried out as described by Spiertz & Ellen (1978).

Crop photosynthesis was measured from anthesis onwards by enclosing an area of 1 m2 in a perspex chamber about 1.20 m high. C02 content was maintained at about 320 mg/kg during daytime; during the dark much higher values occurred. Air temperature was generally kept at 20 °C, but under high radiation conditions cooling capacity was insufficient and this resulted in the temperature rising to a maximum of 25 °C. C02 exchange rate was measured with an URAS infrared gas analyser by sampling ingoing and outgoing air. To prevent gas exchange at soil level the chamber was kept constantly at an overflow pressure, which varied between 0.5 and 2.0 cm H2O. Solar radiation, air temperature and C02 content of air were monitored on recorders and cassette tape. These data were processed by a computer; calculations of net photosynthesis were based on at least four sampling runs.

# **Growing conditions**

# *Weather*

The growing season was characterized by a mild winter followed by exceptionally high temperatures during the first half of March (Fig. 1). During the tillering phase weather was unfavourable: cold, wet and overcast sky. Poor light conditions also occurred during flowering and after mid-kernel filling. High radiation and temperature occurred during the last 10 days of May and the first week of July. Much rain fell during ripening and grain harvest.

# *Diseases*

Although yellow rust was prevalent in wheat crops in the Netherlands in the 1977 growing season, the cultivars in our experiment were only slightly infected.

Early mildew infections were controlled with fungicides. At the end of the kernel-filling period there was a late infection of brown rust *(Puccinia recondita).* 

Fungicide applications caused the leaf tips of Maris Hobbit to turn yellow.
